0,"Microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation - time - and material - dependent. nanograss was the material with significantly lessBiofilm formation, both in microgravity and on earth."
1,"Metagenome - assembled genomes ( mags ) of iss samples are yet to be generated. 46 mags were assembled from 21 iss environmental metagenomes. 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus / species combination ( kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( methylobacterium ajmalii ). Four bins exhibited fungal genomes."
2,The reconstructed genomes will enable researchers to study the evolution of genomes under microgravity and low - dose irradiation. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186 / s40168 - 023 - 01545 - 7. ##miella strains are much more subjective to microgravity changes.
3,"Since the publication of the first metagenome - assembled genome ( mag ) in 2004, mags have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host - microbe relationships. mags generated from international space station environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, kalamiella piersonii."
4,"“ genome to phenome ” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera pantoea from kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several strains that were archived and previously unidentified. among 46 mags generated during this study, functional analyses such as antimicrobial resistance ( amr ), virulence characteristic, and metabolic traits / stress responses were carried out for 20 prokaryotic mags. This is the first - time eukaryoticMags ( ~ 50 % completeness ) were also generated from iss metagenomes using the co - assembly strategy."
5,"46 mags were assembled from 21 iss environmental metagenomes, in which metaspades yielded 20 mags and metawrap generated 26 mags. 18 bacterial species were identified, including one novel genus / species combination ( kalamiella piersonii ) and one novel bacterial species ( methylobacterium ajmalii ). in addition, four bins exhibited fungal genomes; this is the first - time fungal genome was assembled from iss."
6,"Good quality bacterial and fungal mags were generated from iss environmental samples, and functional properties were predicted. monophyletic phylogeny exhibited by the iss genomes ( both isolates and mags ) suggested that they shared a single common ancestor. variations found in the amr and virulence genes enabled the prediction of the ecology and evolution of microorganisms in space."
7," microbiology research into planning, decision - making, and mission design will be paramount to ensuring success of these long - duration missions. utilizing the benefits of microbes, while understanding their limitations, will help us explore deeper into space and develop sustainable human habitats on the moon, mars and beyond."
8,"Nasa has pledged to return humans to the moon in the next two years and land the first humans on mars by 2033. The journey beyond low earth orbit ( leo ) will expand human civilization, enable future space settlements, provide scientific knowledge of the evolution of our planet and the solar system, and create global partnerships."
9," dust storms can affect the efficiency of solar arrays. resupply cargo, like those that are frequently sent to the iss, is costly, and may not be feasible for long - duration space missions. self - sustainability in food and oxygen production on extraterrestrial outposts, such as on the moon and mars, is crucial. increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation during spaceflight could threaten astronaut health. mitigation strategies will be needed to prevent such hazards."
10," increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation during spaceflight could threaten astronaut health and spacecraft integrity. mitigation strategies will be needed to prevent such hazards. microbial applications related to health ( purple ), renewable resources ( green ) or both ( purple and green ) are highlighted. figure created with biorender. com."
11,"Mechanical unloading during microgravity causes skeletal muscle atrophy and impairs mitochondrial energetics. elevated production of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) by mitochondria and nox2 contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the sirt1 activator, srt2104 would rescue unloading - induced mitochondrial dysfunction. mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions."
12,Wild mouse models are critical tools in tuberculosis ( tb ) research. We examined whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of tb in balb / c mice. wildr mice controlled early acute infection better than labc mice. tb reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained.
13,Tuberculosis ( tb) remains a major threat to global public health and years of progress made towards ending tb have been reversed by the covid19 pandemic. predictive preclinical models for testing novel drugs and vaccine candidates are required to achieve the targets set forth in the end tb strategy. introduction of murine pathogens to research poses significant challenges for laboratory animal facilities.
14,Mice experience a rapid loss of fecal microbiota diversity upon mtb infection. depletion of the microbiome by broad - spectrum antibiotics rendered mice more susceptible to tb. restoring the gut microbiota by fecal transfer reduced the bacterial load of mtb. chemotherapy with first - line antimycobacterials led to dysbiosis that persisted beyond the end of drug treatment.
15,"The lungs of wildr mice at 1 day and 14 days post - infection had a significantly lower bacterial burden than labc mice, and this difference dissipated thereafter. In contrast, animals of both cohorts had a similar pathogen load in the spleen at individual time points. This suggests that the gut microbiota may shape innate immunity leading to different degrees of tb control."
16,"The conventional balb / c mouse model is widely used in tb research, including preclinical development of novel therapies. We used animals born to germ - free mothers that were inoculated with the gut microbiota of wild - living mice. fecal samples obtained from individual mice of both cohorts prior to and during tb infection were subjected to dna isolation and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene v4 region."
17,"This tb - induced dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been previously reported in both human and mouse tb infections ( reviewed in [ 33 ] ). given the significant differences in overall community composition between labc and wildr mice, we next applied aldex2 [ 29 ] to detect differentially abundant taxa at the phylum, family, and genus levels ( fig 2d ). at the. phylum level, bacteroidota ( formerly bacteroidetes ) and pseudomonadota were dominant in wildr. mice, whereas bacillota (formerly firmicutes ) and actinobacteriodota were enriched in the labc mice. verrucomicro"
18,"Members of the bacillota phylum including ruminococcus ( family ruminococcaceae ) and multiple lachnospiraceae groups were enriched in labc mice. verrucomicrobiota and campylobacterota were only detected in labC and wildr mice, respectively.wildr mice were enriched for odoribacter, helicobacter and genera within the rikenellaceae family. the sulfur - reducing genera bilophila and desulfovibrio were also differentially abundant in wild r mice."
19,The representation of tb lung pathology in both cohorts was very similar. foamy macrophages appearing more transparent due to their accumulation of lipid bodies filled out many alveolar spaces and were infected with acid - fast bacilli. We conclude that the wild mouse gut microbiome does not impact the number of lung lesions and the lesion organization in the balb / c model.
20,"To determine the impact of the gut microbiota on t cell immunity to tb, we measured the dynamics of cd4, cd8 and γδ t cells during acute and chronic infection. at designated time points after mtb infection, groups of four mice were used to prepare organ single - cell suspensions for flow cytometry analysis of t cell subsets. wildr mice generally had a less pronounced t cell response in the lungs at early time points, compared to labc mice."
21,We examined the protein levels of 23 cytokines and chemokines in the lungs and spleen of labc and wildr mice at the acute and chronic phases of tb infection. Most cytokine and. chemokine levels were much higher in the lung than in the spleens. We thus performed principal component analysis to explore if different gut microbiomes would affect cytokine expressions in response to tb. infection.
22,"Mice having the gut microbiota of their wild - living relatives have better host fitness, improved disease resistance and might model humans more closely. We tested whether introducing the wild mouse gut microbiota to the balb / c host ( wildr ) would alter the representation and course of tb infection. The wildr mice were enrichen in bacteroidota and pseudomonadota, whereas bacillota and actinobacteriodota were enriched in the labc mice."
23,The number of bacilli detected in lungs was lower at 1 - and 14 - days post - infection in wildr mice. The observed difference in lungs did not impact dissemination to the spleen. growing evidence suggests that tb susceptibility is impacted by the microbial community in the gut.
24,"The cytokine and chemokine profiles we measured in infected organs of labc and wildr mice showed a large overlap ( s1 fig ). a principal component analysis of data revealed a clear separation of animals by time points post - infection but not between microbiomes. The nature of the infectious agent, the vastly different inoculation dose, the mouse strain and the choice of experimental endpoints may have contributed to the lack of cytokine profile changes."
25,"This work provides an up - to- date roadmap that identifies critical research gaps related to human behavior and performance in altered gravity and space. We highlight the need for a variety of target - specific countermeasures, and a personalized administration schedule as two critical strategies for mitigating potentially adverse effects of spaceflight on the central nervous system and performance."
26,"The potential damage to neural structures in response to spaceflight and its behavioral implications are not well understood. adverse behavioral conditions, psychiatric disorders, and sensorimotor deficits are considered some of the most serious but also least understood risks during future long - duration space missions. Identifying and predicting the effects of spaceflight on human performance will be critical for successful future exploration class missions."
27,"In 2020, esa released a call for ideas for evolution of the scispace roadmaps in the post 2024 era. pooling the combined expertise of esa with the scientific community and stakeholders across europe led to the identification of four major future roadmaps. The process of creating the roadmaps has involved hundreds of individuals from the wider life science and engineering communities."
28,"This manuscript highlights the esa scispacee research gaps identified in the field of neuroscience as part of the behavioral health & performance roadmap. In the following sections, we identify and discuss some key knowledge gaps related to neurobehavioral performance during human future exploration space missions. We address potential countermeasures to mitigate these risks. We conclude with a summary of key priorities for the roadmaps of current and future space programs, and how addressing these knowledge gaps can benefit people."
29,"Little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain. A greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain, says the study. The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space."
30,"hypervirulent klebsiella pneumoniae ( hvkp ) is a subgroup of k. pneumoniae. It has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals. The international space station is a unique, hermetically sealed environment, subject to environmental pressures not encountered on earth. The findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms."
31,"Genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. While bacteria ' s adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone - specific. considering the documented spaceflight - induced suppression of the human immune system."
32,"Sarcopenia associates with numerous health risk factors and poor quality of life. drugs that counter sarcopenia without harmful side effects are lacking, and repurposing existing pharmaceuticals could expedite realistic clinical options. recent studies suggest bisphosphonates promote muscle health; however, the efficacy of bisph phosphonates as an anti ‐ sarcopenic therapy is currently unclear."
33,"Za delays caenorhabditis elegans sarcopenia, which translates to improved neuromuscular function across the life course. bisphosphonates might, therefore, be an immediately exploitable anti  sarcopenia therapy. Study found no synergistic improvements in za co  treatment vs. knockdown alone."
34,"Sarcopenia is a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly. It is prevalent in at least 10 % of older populations and up to 31 % as a co ‐ morbidity. Despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions, efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited."
35,"Osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate display significant increases in muscle strength and total muscle mass. Recent reports on the most potent bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid ( za ), show improved muscle morphology, strength and mass in rodent models of cancer cachexia, 17 duchenne muscular dystrophy 18 and denervation ‐ induced muscle atrophy."
36," methods using caenorhabditis elegans as a sarcopenia model, we treated animals with 100 nm, 1, 10, 100 and 500 μm zoledronic acid ( za ) and assessed lifespan and healthspan ( movement rates ) using a microfluidic chip device. the effects of za on sarcopenian. the mechanisms of z a ‐ mediated healthspan extension were determined using combined za and targeted rnai gene knockdown across the life ‐ course."
37,"70 young adults were collected and loaded into microfluidic chips ( infinity chips ; nemalife inc., tx ) using a 2. 5 ml syringe. Chips were washed for 90 s with liquid ngm to remove progeny followed by a further 90 s recording for subsequent computational analysis of animal survival and locomotion. both lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluids housed populations."
38, lifespan and healthspan were determined every day using videos of microfluidic ‐ housed populations. average values were taken from movement scores between all three frames. zoledronic acid effects on sarcopenia dystrophic progression with age were visualized and quantified using transgenic strains expressing green fluorescent protein.
39,"The effects of rnai treatments on animal lifespan / healthspan were determined using bacterial feeding vectors and performed in the infinity screening system, as described above. Analysis was carried out in imagej, and the number of well networked, moderately fragmented or severely fragmented muscles were expressed as a percentage of total muscle cells visible."
40,"All bacteria and drug solutions were prepared fresh daily until cessation of life. rnai experiments were always conducted alongside empty vector controls ( pl4440 ). statistics lifespan analysis was performed using kaplan – meier curves assessed by the log ‐ rank ( mantell – cox ) test. for movement rate, area under the curve ( auc ) was performed on mean movement values across each day of adulthood. both mitochondrial and sarcomere quantification were analysed using the percentage classification score from individual animals across biological repeats."
41,"100 nm and 1 μm za increased lifespan ( p < 0. 001 ) and healthspan ( 954 ± 53 ( 100 nm ) and 963 ± 48 ( 1 ω) vs. 834 ± 59 % ( untreated ) population activity auc, p > 0. 05 ]. 10 μm Za shortened lifespan (p < 0, 0001) but not healthspan. 100 and 500 μm. za were larval lethal."
42,"Zoledronic acid extends caenorhabditis elegans lifespan and healthspan. higher za concentrations ( 500 and 100 μm ) were larval lethal, and 10 μm za shortened lifespan ( median survival = 11 vs. 14 days for controls, p < 0. 0001 ; figure 1a ) Without significantly impairing healthspan ( animal movement auc = 758. 9 ± 37. 08 vs. 833. 9 / 59. 91 for controls)"
43,"Animals exposed to 10 μm zoledronic acid ( za) exhibit significant declines in survivability to untreated controls. However, za shows no significant impairment in movement capacity across whole life. Both 1 μm ( b ) and 100 nm ( c ) were beneficial to animal survival. za delayed loss of organized sarcomeres until day 6 post ‐ adulthood."
44," zoledronic acid attenuates age ‐ related loss of sarcomere integrity. za also decreased muscle cells categorized as ‘ moderately disorganized ’ on days 4 ( 17. 0 % vs. 38. 2 %, p < 0. 01 ) and 6 ( 27. 6 vs. 53. 4%) post ‐ adulthood. We next examined the effects of za on mitochondrial integrity, given the strong associations of mitochondrial structure and function with animal health."
45,"Treatment with zoledronic acid did not delay the onset of well ‐ networked mitochondria loss at day 2 ( figure s2 ) or day 4 post ‐ adulthood ( 51. 8 %, p < 0. 0001 ). However, za prevented progressive mitochondrial fragmentation at day 6 ( 46. 7%) compared to untreated animals. The lifespan extending effects of za have previously been attributed to the mevalonate cholesterol / isoprenoid lipid biosynthesis pathway and the foxo family of transcription factors, 21."
46, knockdown of fdps ‐ 1 with za co ‐ treatment ( 1 μm) prevents za mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. Knockdown of daf ‐ 16 ( foxo ) decreases survival and movement. The conserved bone ‐ muscle ortholog agxt ‐ 2 ( baiba ) is required for za- mediated improvement in survival.
47,"Agxt ‐ 2 / baiba, igdb ‐ 1 / fndc5 and let ‐ 756 / fgf21. 24 lifespan and healthspan were unaffected by kd of a muscle ‐ borne bone protective factor 30. combined agxt   2 kd with za treatment was unable to confer life / healthspan extension. inhibition of igDB   1 extended lifespan ( median survival = 11 vs. 7 days for controls, p < 0. 05)"
48,"We examined the role of two c. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir ‐ 2. 2 and sir ‚ 2. 3, 32 for their role in za ‐ mediated lifespan and healthspan extension. We found that knockdown of sir   2. 3 extends lifespan but not healthspan. We also found that combined za treatment and gene inhibition was not synergistically beneficial."
49,"Bisphosphonates ( za ) extend c. elegans lifespan and healthspan, which associates with delayed onset of muscle sarcomere and mitochondrial decline. We establish muscle centric myokines and mitochondrial sirtuin as previously unknown regulators of bisph phosphonate effects on ageing muscle health."
50,"Bisphosphonates increase lifespan through inhibition of the mevalonate metabolic pathway and downstream foxo activation. Dysfunction of this pathway can associate with wide ranging pathologies including cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, cancer and alzheimer ' s disease. Early ‐ to mid ‐ life muscle preservation translates to improved animal health across the entire life course."
51," baiba promotes insulin sensitivity, anti ‐ inflammation 38 and osteocyte survival in mice, 39 and its expression does not decline with age 39 ; thus, baiba ‐ mediated muscle / health benefits of bisphosphonates would be anticipated to remain in older age. knockdown of igdb ‐ 1 / fndc5 extended worm lifespan and healthspan."
52,Chronic bisphosphonate administration delays the onset of muscle structural and mitochondrial decline in a c. elegans model of sarcopenia. This translates to improved animal health across the entire life course. The mechanisms regulating the positive ageing / muscle effects of bisph phosphonates appear to be conserved across species.
53,"Despite surging interest in space travel, the impacts of prolonged, elevated exposure to galactic cosmic radiation ( gcr ) on human health remain poorly understood. This form of ionizing radiation causes significant changes to biological systems including damage to dna structure by altering epigenetic phenotype with emphasis on dna methylation."
54," galactic cosmic radiation ( gcr) consists of heavier atomic nuclei with high linear energy transfer ( high - let ) values which are of great danger for human health. ionizing radiation damages dna structure by inducing double - stranded breaks and base damage. During long exposure, these alterations are likely to increase the risk of cancer and degenerative diseases occurrence."
55,There were a few reports suggesting that high - let 4 and ultraviolet 11 induced dna damage may be affected by chromatin structure. Until now there are no studies investigating a dna methylation pattern induced by low - / high -Let and spatial chromosomal conformation capture. We used hi - c data to create detailed nuclear division introducing five distinct radial nuclear layers.
56,"This research addresses the pressing need to understand the impact of galactic cosmic radiation ( gcr ) on human health. We used the concept of radial nuclear layers to explore how chromatin properties, including histone modifications and spatial conformation, affect dna methylation alterations. This research aims to contribute valuable information for developing strategies to minimize the adverse effects of cosmic radiation during space travel."
57,"We analyzed dna methylation patterns caused by high - let ( 56 fe, 28 si ) and low- let ( x - ray ) participles. regardless of the dose, 56 fe predominantly increases dna. methylation whereas x ray decrease dnaethylation levels when compared to control. contrary to primary article where no effect of 28 si was observed, we discovered its activity in decreasing dnamethylation levels."
58,"56 fe was able to induce hypermethylation of primarily hypomethylated sites and hypometHylation of mostly hypermethylated sites whereas 28 si induced only the latter. 28 si is more likely to affect hypomet HMT sites at control. To investigate specific genomic locations of dmps, we looked at the relation to cpg islands localized in the close relationship of gene promoters 18."
59,"We found that, regardless of radiation type and dose, grouped dmps were more likely located inside promoter regions. It suggests that proximal regulatory regions of human genome are more prone to accumulate radiation induced dna methylation changes. We also found that cpg islands were more prevalent among sites which methylation increased after 56 fe or decreased after 28 si and x exposure."
60,"Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of nucleus division based on the high - throughput chromosome conformation capture ( hi - c ) technique score. chromosomes 13, 10 and 4 have the highest 48 - h dmps frequency after fe 1 gy exposure. to investigate whether the observed dmp frequencies depend on the 3d chromatin structure we divided the nucleus into five distinct layers as shown on fig. 2 b."
61, nucleus layers were created based on the even distribution of all dna methylation probes in order to include the same amount of dna within each layer. chromosomes with the highest dmps frequency are cumulating dna. methylation sites at the “ l2 ” – ‘ l3 ” junction and among the following layers. The methylation change induced by 56 fe persisted until the ‘l5 ’ having the lowest value in ‘L1 ’.
62," histone modifications predispose cells to particular irradiation response. We examined four histone. modifications ( h3k4me3, h3K27ac, h2k27me3 and h3 k9me3) which are known to have a major role in chromatin. organization. We observed the enrichment of h3cme3 among external layers with a decreasing towards inner nucleus layers. that distribution was contrary to other histone modification which level did not depend on the layer."
63,"H heterochromatin - associated marks ( h3k9me3, h3K27me3 ) had higher baseline methylation levels than euchromatin- associated marks. methylation level was rather stable ( p = 0. 22 ; p =0. 087, respectively ) across distinct nucleus layers. among h 3k9 me3, a methylation increase was observed towards the inner layers. when compared the mean absolute methylation change to all dmps, we discovered that the methylated change was higher in all histone marks, regardless of radiation type and dose."
64,"Methylation change was higher in histone mark associated sites, especially among regulatory regions. The highest changes are observed in outer layers of nucleus. regulatory regions associated with histone marks are more prone to accumulate radiation associated damage with regard to dna methylation. These results may highlight the role of histone modifications in response to external radiation, for instance to protect inner euchromatin - associated regions."
65,"To explore the dna methylation changes induced by the selected irradiation, we looked at the methylation change over time. We discovered that regardless of the dose and the direction of methylation. change 56 fe induces persistent dnamethylation changes ( fig. 4 a ; s4 a ). on the other side, 28 si and x induce dnaethylation changes which are not durable. to check if similar effect is observed on functional level, we used gene expression data of the nasa ’ s osdr ( see methods for details )."
66,"In mice heart tissue, irradiated with 56 fe 0. 15 gy particles, we observed corresponding short - term gene expression patterns in mice breast tissue. In blood tissue of jaxa astronauts, we checked if we observe a corresponding pattern in gene expression to dna methylation change right after astronauts were sent to space and exposed to gcr. We also investigated the chronic effect of protons, gamma rays, 137 cs and 57 co on gene expression."
67,"The epigenome imprint was persistent for 56 fe or space exposure when compared with 28 si. as such, we confirmed the previous dna methylation findings on functional level. lastly, we checked for dnamethylation change persistence over time in histone modification peaks, promoters and enhancers regions overlapped with dmps and observed corresponding results to previously established patterns."
68,"Each of investigated radiation types induce distinct dna methylation patterns. methylation changes which occur early, persist over time only when caused by 56 fe particle. after 28 si and x - rays ’ exposure, we found a methylation peak at the beginning and a decrease towards baseline level over time. in line to previous observations a vast majority of identified methylation sites was located in and around cpg islands."
69,"Methylation and gene expression levels in terms of gcr particles as well as astronauts ’ exposure to space radiation. methylation levels in various tissues exposed to spaceflight. to properly examine the persistence of these patterns, multiple timepoints with longer period of observation would be preferred."
70,"We looked at the spatial distribution of epigenetic histone modifications which may also play a role in the context of gcr 11, 46. exposed dna fragments are at the highest exposure to radiation beams which effect decreases with nucleus depth 4. However, despite the highest frequency of dmps observed, the highest dna methylation change and corresponding chromosomal frequencies were observed around the middle layer of the nucleus."
71,"Dna double strand breaks ( dsbs ) are distributed “ randomly, ” without accumulation at the nuclear periphery, but more prevalent in nuclear compartments with low chromatin density. rays penetrate the whole nucleus and lose energy in a random manner along the photon path, and not having bragg peak present due to presence of uncharged photons in x rays."
72,Most dmps were located in chromosomes with low gene expression and located more peripherally compared to chromosomes with high gene expression. The intensity of dna methylation changes correlates with both the low - expression ( heterochromatic ) state of chromatin and the peripheral location of Chromatin. It seems that epigenetic architecture plays a major role in cell response to irradiation.
73,"In human t - lymphocyte cells, simulated - microgravity results in dna hypomethylation 58. gene expression analysis showed a decreased expression of histone deacetylases ( hdac ) 1 which should have resulted in increased acetylation of hist one h3."
74,"Fruit flies and humans exhibit immune system dysfunction in space. Studies examining their immune systems ’ interactions with natural parasites in space are lacking. drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. in this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor - free control and a blood tumor - bearing mutant strain were examined. inflammation - related genes were activated in space in both fly strains."
75,"Study examined the effects of spaceflight on d. melanogaster infested with natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the international space station ( iss ), aboard spacex - 14. larval blood cells ( hemocytes ) of the hosts ’ innate immune system ( macrophage - like plasmatocytes — called macrophages here — and their derivatives, lamellocytes ) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg."
76,"L. leptopilina heterotoma ( lh ) is highly successful on many drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite. L. boulardi ( lb ) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than lh. lb evs also bear spikes, are immune - suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to lh evs. Despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune - deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development."
77,"In this fruit fly lab - 03 ( ffl - 03 ) spaceflight experiment, we compared the development of two fly strains : one healthy and another suffering from chronic inflammation ( ci ). The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the janus kinase ( jak ) gene to activate the transcription factor called signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stat ). The mutation constitutively activates the fly ’ s innate immune jak - stat and toll signaling pathways. components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development."
78,"In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins or ecm - associated proteins ( together, matrisome proteins ) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected. genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. inflammation - related genes were activated in both strains. While the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space - returned ci strain increased."
79,"The ffl - 03 experimental design consisted of two fly - only cultures ( fly strains y w and y w, hop tum - l ) and four fly / parasite co - cultures on each host strain. survival of animals was scored post - flight ( see star methods ). we found that the overall yield of both male and female y w flies in each vial was roughly half of that of the ground - reared flies. While spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly ( average 44 versus 57 males / vial), female development remained unaffected."
80,"Under the ffl - 03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors. animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight ; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly ( average 44 versus 57 males / vial ), female development remained unaffected."
81,"Y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hop tum - l, with 13. 22 % versus 6. 78 % degs ( spaceflight versus ground control samples ), respectively. A separate analysis of white - eyed ( w 1118 ) flies, also on the spacex - 14 mission, reported 6. 49% and 3. 25% degs in s0 versus g0 female and male fly heads, respectively."
82,"The hop tum - l strain showed 9. 69 % degs relative to y w, with more than two - thirds of degs upregulated and the remaining degs downregulated. in space, this differential expression was enhanced ( 14. 03 % of genes affected ), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal ( table s1 ). volcano plots of the four comparisons revealed distinct gene identity profiles in each comparison."
83,"The top degs downregulated in g0 hop tum - l versus g0 y w that maintain their expression patterns in space include members of the lysozyme gene family, histone h4 genes, serine proteases, carboxypeptidases, and other enzymes. Most genes in panel a that maintain differential expression in space are toll pathway target genes 34, 35."
84,"Top degs encode proteins for cuticle ( e. g., chitin - binding domain - containing proteins of the twdl, cplca, and cpr families) Top degs also encode proteins with the gyr / ylp domain or immune response - related proteins ( figure 3 c ). We consider the effects of spaceflight on top degs in individual strains as follows."
85,"We examined the expression of 1, 024 essential genes that have been identified in genetic experiments as indispensable for life. across the four comparisons, we found 137 essential genes to be differentially expressed. The space environment had a profound effect on the differential expression of these genes between the two genetic backgrounds."
86,"The most striking effects of spaceflight were seen in y w flies. 96 genes were either upregulated ( 24 genes ) or downregulated ( 72 genes ) in space - flown samples compared to respective ground control samples. gene expression changes were milder in hop tum - l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected."
87,"We identified 34 high - scoring degs that we grouped into broad categories. 22 degs were significantly downregulated in s0 y w versus g0 yW flies. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation. The remaining 17 essential degs, with a low diopt value ( i. e., < 12 ), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions."
88,"High levels of jak - stat pathway genes tota, diedel, et, and cg4793 in hop tum - l versus y w were maintained in space. Several toll pathway components ( pgrps sa, sb1, and sd, grass, spe ) and target genes were significantly upregulated in g0 hop tum- l versus g0 y w flies."
89,"Many immune genes are constitutively active in hop tum - l flies, remarkably, spaceflight activated the expression of a majority of these immune genes in y w flies. elevated expression of pathway components ( cg8046, toll - 9, figure 5 b ), pathogen recognition receptors ( prrs, pgrps sa, sb1, sd), and other toll / imd pathway target genes ( figure 5 e ) was observed in s0 y w versus g0 yW flies. tumors were not detected in s 0 y w animals, even though they showed evidence of high immune signaling."
90,"300 females and 150 adult males were raised either in the iss or at ksc ( see star methods ) at 22°c, and then at 25°C, once returned to the laboratory. tumors were scored in larval and adult samples. high immune gene expression persists in naive s1 larvae as in the mutant hop tum - l adults."
91,"In naive s1 y w larvae included cg10764, lubel, pgrp - sb1, - sc1a, and amp genes, cecb, attc, drs, and drsl5 ( figures s3 a – s3d ). similarly, naive s 1 hop tum - l larvae showed elevated expression of immune targets dpta, dptb, ceca2, drsl3, dr sl5, and ceca1 relative to their g1 counterparts. thus, in both genetic backgrounds, immune signaling was elevated in s1 larvae, even though the affected target genes were different."
92,L lb17 attack elicits encapsulation of the wasp egg due to an overabundance of circulating hemocytes ( not recruited into the melanized tumors ) lh14 - infected hop tum - l larvae instead develop small melanized specks 8 ( see figure s4 for examples of immune reactions )
93,Tumor score higher in naive s1 compared to g1 hop tum - l larvae. s1 hosts are also more immune reactive than g1 hosts. space wasps of both species differed from ground wasps in their ability to elicit encapsulation. at mounting an immune response.
94,"A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart. All anterior lobes of naive g0 and s0 hop tum - l larvae were dispersed due to the effect of the mutation ( figures s5 i – s5p ). the mutation also results in some lobes detaching from the dorsal vessel, and many gFP - positive lamellocytes were present."
95,Lh14 infection results in the gradual loss of hemocytes in all lobes. this effect is attributed to the presence of evs in the entire lymph gland. evs were present in hematopoietic progenitor cells and dorsal vessels of g0 and s0 lh - infected g1 and s1 y w hosts. The venom fluid containing the evs is injected into the host during oviposition.
96,"More than 80% of downregulated degs showed log ( 2 ) - fc between −1. 00 and −2. 00 ( 228 / 280 in lb17 and 250 / 261 in lh14 ). Only 6 of all degs showing a log (2 ) -fc > 2 for lb17; this number was 16 for lh 14. these degs do not appear to belong to a specific functional class, and many lack clear annotations."
97,"A rhogap superfamily protein called lbgap in lb evs is implicated in wasp virulence. In lb17, 29 / 312 ( 9. 89 % ) ev genes were significantly differentially expressed. In lh14, only 5 / 398 ( 1. 61 % ) transcripts were significantly expressed. of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations."

99,Figure 8 a shows the master record for lb17 transcriptome in the transcriptome shotgun assembly. 50 genbank accession numbers and e - values of the domain or protein family are shown. Transcripts are organized by log ( 2 ) - fc in their expression. id refers to the lb identifier for each transcript labeled in the volcano plot in figure 8 a. conserved domains and motifs were detected via the conserved domain database.
100,The yields per vial of each wasp species reared in space were comparable to those of ground control samples. spaceflight did not significantly affect the overall development of wasps. The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hop tum - l hosts in space and also on earth.
101,We found no significant difference in space - versus ground - reared wasp samples. both wasp species raised on either fly host showed equal success in flight and ground conditions. an ex vivo assay was used to detect changes in g0 versus s0 l. heterotoma virulence. lamellocytes from laboratory-reared hop tum - l larvae were exposed to venom fluid from g0 or s0 wasps.
102,"We obtained two recessive mutations in lh14. in the aurum 1 mutant, melanization of the wings is affected, making the normal wings appear golden. In rare cases, this kona 1 mutation was incompletely penetrant, where only one wing was affected. to our knowledge, these are the only live mutant animals in this class of wasps."
103,"The aurum and kona loci appear to be unlinked, as f2 males from unmated heterozygous females were scored in roughly equal proportions. The ovipositors of kona 1 homozygotes showed structural defects, including branched termini instead of the sharp, needle - like ends of the wild - type lh Ovipositor."
104,"Kona 1 / kona 1 females are sterile due to their inability to oviposit. ovaries and eggs are morphologically indistinguishable from wild - type or heterozygous females. thus, it appears that oogenesis is likely unaffected in kona1 mutants, and they are sterile."
105," american scientists first launched fruit flies into space in 1947. Since then more than 20 spaceflight experiments with fruit flies have been conducted. Despite suffering from cardiac and neurological deficits, drosophila born in space can largely survive the dual challenges of short - term exposure to microgravity and radiation."
106,"Cuticle - related degs were upregulated in one of the two s0 genetic strains, but not in the other s0 strain. Other degS were downregulated in s0 flies of both genetic backgrounds. This result suggests that transcriptional co - regulation of promoters among top deg family members may be adaptive to either or both genetic and environmental variables."
107,"The highly inflamed state of hop tum - l animals provided physiological insights into the modest changes in wasp virulence due to spaceflight. We hypothesized that stress from spaceflight could compromise the development of either of the two partners : the fly or the parasite. because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development."
108," parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. lb17 was less successful on d. melanogaster than lh14. 8 global gene expression changes in space - raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1. 5 % of the adult parasite transcripts were affected."
109,"Only one of the two predicted rhogap superfamily genes shares structural similarity with the known lbgap virulence protein, 49 and even its expression was weakly downregulated in space. transcript levels of only 29 / 312 lb17 ev genes were significantly affected with all but one gene being downregulated. in an ex vivo assay, lh14 venom from s0 wasps was no different in its ability to distort lamellocytes than lh13 venom from g0 wasPS."
110,"Chronic exposure to radiation levels likely resulted in dna damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host - parasite biology."
111," availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive g0 / s0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments. This is a strong consideration for designing future experiments. It would have been a good idea to have a large number of flies to culture."
112,"Plant signaling ( ps ) and plant rna regulation ( prr ) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the international space station. genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. However genes involved with defense response, abiotic stress, ca + + signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets."

114," understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments."
115,Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. two critical cues – light and gravity – have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. the european modular cultivation system ( emcs ) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the iss for many years. spaceflight experiments have attempted to uncouple light andgravity stimuli.
116,"Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial g levels. These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts. in this study, we compare the response of arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the iss. partial gravity."
117,Plant signaling ( ps ) and plant rna regulation ( prr ) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the international space station utilizing the european modular cultivation system ( emcs ) The emcs provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control.
118,"Seeds were dry - mounted on membranes and remained dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run. following hydration and illumination, seedlings from ps and prr germinated with high frequency. morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in ps, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in prr."
119,"The overlap between the two experiments for both μ g upregulated and μ g downregulated deg lists was significant ( table 1 ). both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in. µ g and 399 genes downregulated in µ g. go annotation revealed enrichment of the go terms, “ regulation of transcription ” and “ auxin signaling ” in the common µ g up regulated genes. “ cell wall ’ and ‘ response to stress ’ were go terms enriched in theCommon µ g downregulation genes. rna - seq reads from ps and prr were re- analyzed to impart increased statistical power."

125,"We also detected 6 arf s upregulated in µ g. arfs are tfs that are bound by aux / iaa repressors and remain inactive in the absence of auxin. Three of the arfs detected in this dataset are implicated in leaf development, while arf6 and arf17 play a role in flowering. The cellular compartments overrepresented in the µ g upregulated dataset are golgi and the nucleus."
126,"We analyzed regions upstream of the transcript initiation site using multiple expectation maximizations for motif elicitation ( meme ) software. There were 258 occurrences of this motif in 174 unique genes ( 15. 6 % of total input genes) This motif predominantly occurred in the - 100 to - 0 bp region upstream of transcript initiation sites, as seen in the density analysis."
127," genes downregulated in µ g, compared to 1 g in space. This overall dampening of stress response genes includes a downregulation of genes encoding several members of cytochrome p450 family, 14 glutathione s - transferases, and members of a mate efflux family involved in detoxification. The downregulated tfs include those implicated in biotic stress and plant defense."
128,"The largest groups of tf downregulated in µ g are 15 ethylene response factors ( erf ) s and 12 wrky tfs ( phukan et al., 2016 ). wrkyTfs in our dataset appear to function chiefly in abiotic or biotic stress responses. Approximately 200 genes were associated with plant defense and response to biotic stimuli. This category includes 24 disease - resistance proteins, different classes of receptor - like protein kinases."
129,"Given the enhancement in stress responses, it is not surprising that approximately 40 genes involved in calcium signaling were downregulated in µ g. This category includes calcium binding proteins, calcium - dependent protein kinases, and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels ( cngc ) s. ##44, div2, hb7,. nac032, nac102 and rd26 ) are downregulated."

132, > 400 genes are associated with stress responses. These responses have been reported as upregulated in spaceflight experiments compared to ground controls. This group of genes was specifically downregulated in µ g compared to 1 g suggesting that microgravity masks the induction of these genes in the space environment.
133," expression profiles of deg subsets across 1 g, µ g, and ground control conditions. mirnas act to regulate gene expression either by the cleavage of their target mrnas, or by repression of translation or dna methylation. 3 mirnas – mir319c, mir863 - 5p and mir398b - 3p – were upregulated in µ g."
134,"The mirna family is closely associated with and regulates several squamosa promoter binding like ( spl ) tfs. mir156 has been shown to modulate seedling growth in response to temperature and light changes via its interaction with spl9. The experimental design of prr with staggered hydration allowed for some samples to be initiated 48h later, yielding two time points."
135,"The experimental design of prr with staggered hydration allowed for some samples to be initiated 48h later, yielding two time points ( day 4 and day 6 ) from the same experiment. our major focus was on degs detected at day 6, described in the preceding sections. comparing the effects of microgravity on the day 4 or day 6 plants revealed interactions between plant developmental stage and microgravity. these interactions are apparent in the pca plot of the prr day 4 & 6 flight samples."
136," genes associated with cell wall organization were also found to be downregulated at both days. scatter plots of representative genes in this group clearly indicate that the differential expression observed at day 4 did not persist at day 6. Taken together, these results suggest that the developmental window the samples are in could influence the observed transcription response profiles."
137, ps and prr spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. genes upregulated in µ g compared to the 1 g control were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated tfs function in mediating plant stress responses. We identified specific mirnas that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets.
138," genes downregulated in µ g in with the red light photostimulation ( villacampa et. al., 2021 ) were enriched in the go categories response to bacterium and fungus. These results further reinforce the idea that both biotic and abiotic stress responses appear to be specifically downregulated."
139,"Glycomic analysis of spaceflight plant samples have shown changes in cell wall glycans, consistent with spaceflight related modification of cell walls. We found approximately 100 genes associated with cell wall organization and modification downregulated in µ g. We also found cellulose synthase - like genes and 6 genes encoding for dirigent proteins which are involved in lignin biosynthesis to be downregulated. The mis - regulation or altered regulation of photosynthesis related genes has been reported for many spaceflight experiments."
140," genes involved in photosynthesis were enriched in both the upregulated and downregulated datasets. genes encoding for subunits of the nadph complex, lhca and photosystem i and ii core were downregulated in both ps and prr. hy5 is a central regulator of photomorphogenesis and may directly or indirectly affect the expression of approximately one third of the arabidopsis genome."
141,"We found some gravitropism related genes to be upregulated in µ g. These genes were associated with organ development, light responses and auxin transport. Many of the downregulated hy5 targets were involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses. The influence of developmental stage on observed transcriptional responses can be seen in the differences in gene expression at day 4 and day 6."
142,The developmental stage of the seedlings can have a profound effect on observed transcriptional responses. Many more genes were responsive to µ g at day 6 than at day 4. longer duration experiments with a finer resolution of time points would be required to fully characterize and understand the regulatory underpinnings for these differences.
143,"Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plant development. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment. The seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity."
144,The biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment. moving forward it will be important to employ multiple omics approaches to study a spaceflight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the iss such as veggie and the advanced plant habitat ( aph ) can better support these endeavors.
145,Skeletal muscle size and strength are important for overall health for astronauts. How male and female muscle may respond differently to micro - and partial - gravity environments is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence the progression of muscle atrophy.
146,Skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the international space station and future missions to the moon and mars. exposure to microgravity ( or microgravity analogs ) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models.
147,Research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. One study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading. Another study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially - targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse.
148,Sex differences in the etiology of muscle loss have not been fully resolved. Sex steroid hormones may act to augment or mitigate sex differences during disuse atrophy. alterations to muscle function will be imperative for nasa to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness and safety in the astronaut corps.
149,"120 male ( m ) and female ( f ) fisher rats were obtained from charles river laboratories ( wilmington, ma, stock number : 002 ). at 12 weeks of age, the rats underwent either castration / ovariectomy ( cast / ovx ) or sham ( sham ) surgeries. immediately prior to and after interventions, animals underwent a series of tests to evaluate changes in musculoskeletal strength. after post - intervention testing, animals were euthanized with 30 % – 70 % carbon dioxide of chamber volume per minute."
150," rats were fed standard laboratory chow throughout the study. food was weighed daily to ensure appropriate consumption. animals were weighed weekly to ensure they did not have excessive bodyweight loss. if an animal exhibited extreme signs of stress, it was removed from the study and euthanized. grip strength : hindlimb grip strength was evaluated as we have previously described."
151,"15 anesthetized animals ( % isoflurane ) were positioned and images were captured 40 mm from the tibial plateau. Images were analyzed to decipher different tissue densities and corresponding area with specified software provided by the manufacturer. cross - sectional data ( e. g., muscle fiber areas and tissue weights ) were analyzed as percent difference from within sex and hormonal status ( sham, cast / ovx ) controls."
152,"All data analysis was completed with sas statistical software ( sas institute, cary, nc, united states ). all sas coding ( including datasets ), sas outputs, and a pictorial description of the experimental design are available in supplementary files. 18 All data were analysed using the procedure mixed ( proc mixed ) function."
153,"Females lost more bodyweight compared to males, but had similar loss in rear paw grip strength during 28 - day interventions. In rats post - gonadectomy, f - ovx - 0g had greater bodyweight loss compared to m - cast - 0G. at 0. 4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males."
154,"Fig. 3. 2 females lost more muscle leg girth and corresponding muscle cross - sectional area compared to males in both intact and gonadectomized rats. at 0. 4g, there were no differences in hindlimb grip strength between females and males in sham ( fig. 1 g ) or ovx / cast conditions."
155,"At 0. 4 g in sham and ovx / cast animals, females had greater loss in total muscle fiber area than males. At 0. 3 g, there were no differences between females and males in relative difference in muscle fiber areas. fig. 3 muscle fiber cross - sectional area differences in the soleus muscle between males and females undergoing exposure to micro - gravity."
156,"At 0g, in both sham and ovx / cast rats there were no relative differences in the changes in myosin heavy chain type ii positive ( type ii ) fibers between females and males ( fig. 3 i – j ). at 0. 4g, sham females were not different than males in the relative loss of type ii fibers. In muscle fibers expressing both type i and type ii isoforms ( hybrid fibers), there was no difference between sham and cast females after 0g intervention."
157,"In 0g cast / ovx animals, females had a greater loss in hybrid fibers compared to males. in type ii fiber area, though this did not reach significance ( −35. 3 % v. −17. 1 %, fig. 3 l ). in muscle fibers expressing both type i and type ii isoforms ( hybrid fibers ), there was no difference between sham females and males at 0 g."
158,"At 0g, females lost more plantar flexion power compared to males under both sham and ovx / cast conditions. At 0. 4g, female rats had greater loss in hindlimb muscle mass compared to male rats. In sham 0g rats, females tended to have attenuated differences in gastrocnemius mass, though this difference was not significant ( −26. 4 % v. −32. 7 %, fig. 5 a ). contrastingly, in ovx or cast 0g rat conditions, females had greater decreases in gastric mass."
159,Females in both sham and ovx conditions tended to have greater decreases in gastrocnemius mass compared to males at 0. 4g. Neither of these differences reached significance. There were no differences between females and males in relative soleus alterations at 0g in either sham or ovx / cast conditions.
160,"At 0g in both sham and ovx / cast conditions, females had greater decreases in soleus mass compared to males. At 0. 4g there were no differences between females and males in ta mass change, regardless of hormonal status. at 0g, sham females had attenuated extensor digitorum longus ( edl ) loss compared to. males ( −8.1 % v. −15. 7 %, fig. 5 m ). however, this difference was not observed in oxv / cast rats. after exposure to 0.4g, there were. no differences in edl changes between the sexes,Regardless of sham or ovx or cast conditions."
161,"There remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. Our study builds on prior research in this domain 8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. These differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses."
162,"If sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. Yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. It is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females."
163,"We speculate that strain differences ( wistar v. fischer ) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. Prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males. We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskel."
164,"We postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskeletal losses, regardless of sex. at 0g, it is possible that males and females have both maximized the physiologically possible muscle loss due to disuse, which may have concealed potential sex differences. exposure to 0. 4g, which is a comparatively milder stimulus, allowed for the presentation of subtle differences."
165,Female rats have greater loss in muscle size and strength compared to male rats after exposure to long - duration partial or full unloading. These differences are conserved regardless of the presence or absence of sex hormones. More research is likely needed to fully evaluate the influence of biological sex on disuse - induced muscle loss.
166,"Based on this rat data, females have accelerated muscle loss during exposure to micro - or partial - gravity environments. interventions to mitigate these losses may need to be sex - specific in order to ensure astronaut safety and future mission successes. and potential preventive therapies of muscle loss and approaches for accelerating recovery."
167, telomere elongation occurred during spaceflight and shortened after return to earth. cell - free dna analysis revealed increased immune cell signatures post - flight. no significant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential ( chip ) or whole - genome instability was observed.
168,"Human spaceflight frequency has increased over the last decade, and with it, our grasp of its effects on human physiology. determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long - term human presence in space. to date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. more recently, spacex launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the inspiration4 ( i4 ) mission."
169,"The nasa twins study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long - duration spaceflight. mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as dnmt3a and tet2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts. it is imperative to study these adaptations in this context for future space missions."
170,"i4 launched from kennedy space center ' s launch complex 39a and traveled into low - earth orbit across a three - day mission. We collected dried blood spots pre -, during, and post - flight for dna extraction. telomere length was measured by quantitative pcr, while whole genome and cfdna sequencing provided insight into genomic stability and immune adaptations."
171,Three 3 mm circular punches were cut from the whatman 903 protein saver cards ( cat # wha10534612) Blood samples were placed into a 1. 5 ml microcentrifuge tube with sterile tweezers. Dna samples were sent to colorado state university for multiplex qpcr analysis.
172,A bio - rad cfx - 96 qpcr machine was used to measure telomere length. The melting curve was established by a 72°c to 95°c ramp at 0. 5°c / second increase with a 30 second hold. The extracted dna was quantified using thermo fisher qubit dsdna hs assay kit ( cat # q238253 ) and 8 samples were prepared using the kapa hyperprep kit.
173,"The 8 dna libraries generated with the kapa hyperprep kit were processed using adept library compatibility kit ( element biosciences, cat # 830 – 00003 ) individually circularized with 0. 5pmol ( 30 μl of 16. 67nm ) input. The libraries were pooled into 4 separate 2 - plex pools, each denatured and sequenced on element aviti system. reads were aligned against the hg38 human reference genome with bwa mem and subjected to standard qc and deduplication procedures."
174,"Cfdna was isolated from 500 μl aliquots of plasma from cfdna blood collection tubes ( streck, # 230470) cFDna was extracted from each crew member from all timepoints ( 4 crew members, 6 timepoints, 24 total extractions ) using the tidyverse ( v1. 3. 2 ) suite of packages. yield was measured for each sample using thermo fisher qubit 1x dsdna hs assay ( cat # q33231 ). entire extract volume was used as input for library preparation using nebnext ultra ii dna library preparation kit."
175,All samples from the testing and validation cohort were sequenced using a custom designed dna sequencing assay. libraries were prepared from 250 ng gdna using the variantplex protocol. a pileup analysis as performed in bolton et al. 2020 [ 11 ] was used to query variants in longitudinal follow- ups.
176,"Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using r ( v4. 1. 2 ), rstudio ( v2021. 09. 2 ) and libraries ( tidyverse, dplyr, data. table, ggplot2 ). cfdna fragment analysis fragment size distribution was calculated using the bampefragmentsize tool from the deeptools python package ( v3. 5. 1 ). levels of cFDna ( read counts ) originating from different chromosomes were normalized by chromosome length and total number of reads in the library."
177,"Data was processed in r using the seurat package ( v4. 3. 0 ) to normalize, scale and cluster cell populations. cell identities were determined through computational gating parameters of inclusion based on gene expression of key markers. Data wrangling, tidying, and visualizations were performed using r (v4. 1. 2 ), rstudio ( v2021. 09. 2 ) and libraries."
178," telomere length shortened rapidly upon return to earth in 3 of the 4 astronauts ( post - flight ), and overall continued to shorten over the course of the recovery period. post hoc pairwise comparisons identified pre - flight vs in - flight ( p < 0. 001 ) and pre- flight vs r + 1 ( p = 0. 02 ) as timepoints between which significant differences in telomeres occurred."
179,"Tissue of origin deconvolution reveals an increased cfdna signature of both adaptive and innate immune cells post - landing and during recovery. Despite the short duration of the i4 mission ( 3 days of orbital flight ), these results correlated with findings from the nasa twins study ( one year mission astronaut ), as well as with astronauts on month missions onboard the international space station."
180, cf - mtdna enrichment was only observed in the twin astronauts on the iss after months of exposure to the space environment. The most represented sequences were of hematopoietic origin. A small increased presence of cfdna fragments from both innate and adaptive immune cells was observed post - landing and during the recovery period.
181,"We performed deep targeted sequencing ( > 15, 000x ) of 10 known epigenetic regulators and chip - associated genes. We assessed the mutational burden of short duration spaceflight in the i4 astronaut cohort. notably, the mutations did not change as a function of spaceflight and remained stable for up to 6 months post spaceflight. putative driver mutations were found in two out of the four astronauts but their vaf remained comparable at all timepoints."
182,"Both astronauts presented increased clonality when compared to previous timepoints. their mutational burden was still greater than age - matched controls, as established in the original study. the analysis of variant annotations revealed that most identified variants are within intronic regions and have no significant effects. we also have noted no disproportional mutational load for variants post - flight ( fig. 3a & c )"
183,"The analysis of variant annotations ( fig. 3a & c ) revealed that most identified variants are within intronic regions and have no significant effects. we also have noted no disproportional mutational load for variants post - flight. we performed variant calling in single nucleus rna -seq ( snrna - seq ) libraries and compared it against wgs for genes with read coverage > 10x. whole genome coverage of the snrNA - seq libraries varied broadly across timepoints, but did not show any significant evidence of genomic instability within our cohort."
184,"Cells were filtered from pbmcs at six different timepoints. gene expression of cd8 + t cells at r + 1 and r + 82 showed increased expression of genes related to immune function, ribosomal and mitochondrial activity. plcg2, mtrnr2l12, vcan, and maml2 transcripts were consistently downregulated across all cell types."
185,"The proportion of cells expressing these genes does not necessarily change in parallel with total gene expression levels. for example, plcg2 expression, on a per cell basis, decreased, but the total proportion of. cells expressing plcG2 increased among cd8 + t cells. gene expression of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, particularly subunits 2 and 3, increased across all cell types, per cell, for r + 1 compared to l - 92 and r + 82. mtrnr2l12 expression was consistently decreased across all studied cell types for r - 92 but greatly increased for r & 82."
186,"i4 mission is the first study to date to analyze the effect of short duration spaceflight on civilians using a comprehensive multi - omics approach. Our findings, including telomere length dynamics, chip - related clonal expansion, wgs genomic stability, and immune cell longitudinal gene expression profiling, broadly contextualize the physiological burdens of spaceflight. This study adds key chip and genetic data on astronauts, which are limited, and can serve as a reference for future spaceflight planning."
187,"Short duration spaceflight has subtler impact on cfdna concentration than long duration missions. Increased innate and adaptive immune system activity is still apparent. No relationship between spaceflight and increased chip - related genetic abnormalities in the scale of three months after spaceflight. No evidence to suggest a clinical effect on the subjects, that is, spaceflight having no discernible effects up to 3 months after flight."
188,i4 mission uniquely positioned to characterize the clonal dynamics associated with a short - duration flight. there is an opportunity to study the compound effects of spaceflight between missions on ch abnormalities if one or more of the i4 astronauts returns to space. this can be leveraged for a better understanding of long - term risk and clonal evolution.
189,i4 cohort provides a unique opportunity to assess the short and long term physiological effects of a singular spaceflight mission. longitudinal gene expression analyses revealed a conserved trend across both adaptive and innate immune cells that had not been described before in the spaceflight literature. transient changes in mitochondrial gene expression were seen as a response to spaceflight across a broad range of immune cells within the i4 cohort.
190,"Mtrnrl12 and mtrnr2l8 are pseudogenes thought to be involved in negative regulation of the execution phase of apoptosis. increased immune cell death was seen in our cfdna analysis, at all post - flight timepoints. Most mitochondrial genes return to basal levels of expression in our l - 92 vs r + 82 comparison, suggesting relief from mitochondrial oxidative stress."
191,"In the spaceflight literature, human induced pluripotent stem cell - derived cardiomyocytes had increased expression of genes related to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, mitochondrial transit peptide, mitochondrial translocation, and mitoribosomes. Our findings reveal a more complex picture of mitochondrial gene expression changes where some are consistently upregulated across cell types and others are transiently downregulated."
192,"Microgravity - induced changes can result in decreased neutrophil and macrophage phagocytic activity. microgravity may alter monocyte maturation and function, which play a critical role in antigen presentation and t cell activation. latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights."
193,"A 12 - year iss immune data comparison indicated improvements in immunity, stress, and viral reactivation. similar adaptations occurred during iss missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact. such operational and biomedical considerations from earlier missions can help future crews and missions maintain crew health and safety."
194," chip sequencing data will serve as a reference point for studying the early development of chip in astronauts. This is an understudied phenomenon as previous studies have focused on career astronauts. this study will serving as areference point for future commercial and non - commercial spaceflight, low earth orbit ( leo ) missions, and deep - space exploration."
195," background african swine fever virus ( asfv ) is a major threat to pig production and the lack of effective vaccines underscores the need to develop robust antiviral countermeasures. We screened a library of 297 natural, anti - inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected vero cells against virus - induced cytopathic effect."
196,"The online version of this article includes supplementary material. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186 / s12985 - 024 - 02374 - 2. supplementary information.

197," methods using the laboratory - adapted asfv ba71v strain. We screened a library of 297 natural, anti - inflammatory compounds to identify promising candidates that protected vero cells against virus - induced cytopathic effect. virus yield reduction, virucidal, and cell cytotoxicity experiments were performed on positive hits. Two lead compounds were further characterized in dose - dependent assays."
198,A library of 297 natural compounds was obtained from chemfaces ( china) The compounds were selected based on their known anti - inflammatory properties and undocumented efficacy against asfv. Each compound was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) as a 5 mg ml − 1 stock solution and diluted in emem. dilutions in the cell culture medium.
199,"The percentage of cpe inhibition was calculated by the following formula : ( od tv - od v / od c - odv ) × 100 % where od refers to the optical density of each well. asfv - infected cells treated with a minimal concentration of dmso ( < 0. 5 % ) were utilized as the negative control, while asfV - infected Cells treated with 50 µm of apigenin were used as the positive control. the od values obtained from these controls were used to calculate the z ’ - factor, which is a statistical parameter to assess the variability of the screening assay."
200,"Vero cells ( 2 × 10 5 cells per well ) were infected with the asfv ba71v strain. cells were treated with selected compounds at different concentrations in a two - fold dilution format. after a 24 - h post - infection, the supernatant was harvested and subjected to titration."
201," vero cells or macrophages were exposed to the selected compounds before ( − 2 h ) infection with the asfv ba71v strain. The compounds were then added to the cells and incubated at 37 °c, allowing virus entry to proceed for 1 h. subsequently, the compounds were removed by washing with 1× pbs to prevent their effect on later stages of infection. The supernatant was collected and titrated 24 h post - infection."
202, cytotoxicity of natural compounds was examined in vero cells and pams by using the crystal violet staining method [ 21 ]. cells ( 2 × 10 4 cells per well ) reached confluence and were then exposed to increasing compound concentrations. The relative viability of the treated cells compared to mock - treated cells ( no compound ) was expressed as a percentage.
203,"The release of tnf - α, il - 1β, and il - 6 cytokines into the culture medium was quantified using commercially available elisa kits. antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) conjugated secondary antibodies. bands were visualized by using a chemidoc xrs imaging system from biorad."
204,"We screened a 297 - member library of natural compounds with anti - inflammatory properties. alkaloids, phenols, and triterpenoids represented approximately 16 %, 11 %, and 10 % of all tested compounds. The screening process was conducted by using a cell - based colorimetric assay in combination with the mtt method to track cpe development."
205,"Paeonol, pinoresinol, curcumin, berbamine, and tetrandrine were selected based on cpe inhibition levels of 54 %, 57 %, 66 %, 86 %, and 101 %, respectively. All five compounds displayed statistically significant ( p < 0. 05 ) antiviral effects on asfv replication in vero cells."
206,"Tetrandrine significantly decreased the viral titer from 6. 4 ± 0. 1 log tcid 50 ml − 1 to 2. 8 ± 1 logtcid 50ml − 1, resulting in a 3. 6 log reduction. berbamine had the second greatest inhibitory effect. paenol and pinoresinol exhibited the weakest inhibitory effects, reducing the viral yield by only 1 log, and curcumin had only a slightly greater inhibitory Effect."
207,"Vero cells infected with asfv were treated with berbamine and tetrandrine at varying concentrations. The inhibitory effect of both compounds occurred in a dose - dependent manner ( fig. 3 a, b ). statistically significant antiviral activity ( p < 0. 05 ) was observed at the lowest concentrations of 12. 5 µm. The compounds did not demonstrate cytotoxicity at tested concentrations, indicating their antiviral effects were independent of cell toxicity."
208," berbamine and tetrandrine significantly hampered the synthesis of p30 and p72 proteins at 50 µm and 25 µm concentrations, respectively. The inhibitory effect was less pronounced at lower concentrations. The antiviral efficacy of these compounds is consistent regardless of the initial viral load infecting cells."
209," berbamine demonstrated a 1 - log reduction in viral titer when asfv - infected cells were exposed to this compound for 24 h. in contrast, tetrandrine achieved a similar level of viral. titer reduction after 16 h of treatment. as the greatest antiviral effect was observed at 72 h post - infection, we also studied the incubation duration required for 1- log ( 90 % inhibition ) reduction."
210, berbamine and tetrandrine inhibited virus particle attachment to vero cells. Both compounds reduced the viral yield below the detection limit corresponding to < 2. 2 log tcid 50 ml − 1. The results suggest that both compounds hamper asfv replication by interfering with early stages of infection.
211, berbamine and tetrandrine inhibit asfv infection by blocking virus entry. monocytes and macrophages are the main target cells for asfV replication in pigs. both compounds reduced the viral yield below the detection limit corresponding to < 2. 2 log tcid 50 ml − 1. altogether.
212," berbamine and tetrandrine decreased the asfv yield from 5. 03 ± 0. 16 log hadu 50 ml − 1 to 3. 25 ±0. 09 log hadU 50 ml - 1 ( p < 0. 01 ), respectively. A more potent inhibitory effect was observed when the compounds were added at the internalization substage. Based on these results, we conclude that berbamines exerted significant inhibition of asfV infection by disrupting the viral entry process. this inhibition was observed independently from the host cell type or asf v strain used in our experiments."
213," berbamine and tetrandrine have generally recognized anti - inflammatory properties such as reducing lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) stimulation of macrophages. Their effects on curbing asfv infection - related inflammation are unknown. as different immune - activating biological processes can involve various signaling pathways [ 30 ] it is thus important to evaluate anti- inflammatory effects in disease - specific contexts in terms of the etiological agent, cell type and measured inflammation markers."
214," berbamine and tetrandrine treatment had strong effects on inhibiting pro - inflammatory cytokine production compared to the levels found in untreated asfv - infected cells. Both compounds significantly reduced tnf - α, il - 1β, and il - 6 levels by around 60 – 80 % at 24 h post - infection compared to uninfected pams. At 48 h post-infection, only the inhibitory effect of tetr andrine was greater ( p < 0. 05)"
215,"Both compounds displayed anti - inflammatory activity in asfv - infected pams. While tetrandrine demonstrated a superior activity profile in terms of greater inhibitory levels and more sustained effect throughout the course of infection. collectively, our findings demonstrate that both compounds, especially tetr andrine with its high effectiveness, possess the ability to not only impede as fv replication but also to mitigate asfV - induced production of clinically important pro - inflammatory cytokines."
216,"Asfv remains a significant threat to the global swine industry and is characterized by its devastating impact on pig populations. The absence of preventive measures against asfv highlights the critical need to discover effective interventions to control and manage this highly contagious disease in pigs. In the present context, further mechanistic investigations focused on berbamine and tetrandrine revealed their dose - dependent antiviral activities. Both compounds exhibited sustained antiviral effects over multiple replication cycles."
217,"Both compounds exhibited sustained antiviral effects over multiple replication cycles. The most significant antiviral effect was observed during the prolonged presence of compounds in the cell culture medium. We also demonstrated that berbamine and tetrandrine effectively reduced the production of pro - inflammatory cytokines, namely tnf - α, il - 1β, and il - 6."
218,rbamine and tetrandrine can not only suppress viral replication but also demonstrate the capability to mitigate pathological conditions associated with the heightened production of pro - inflammatory cytokines due to viral infection. These findings are particularly significant because berbamine and. other bis - benzylisoquinoline alkaloids have also been recently reported to inhibit. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus ( pedv ) with similar potency.
219,"Microbes, especially fungi, can be found in dust and grow when unexpected, elevated moisture conditions occur. We show that bacterial and fungal communities are different in dust collected from vacuum bags on earth and the iss. These findings can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthy indoor microbiomes that support crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection."
220,"Human activity in space will rapidly expand both in low - earth orbit ( leo ) and beyond to an estimated $ 1. 4 trillion dollar industry. nasa ’ s artemis missions, which will send humans back to the moon, includes a lunar orbiting space station ( the lunar gateway ) as well as a lunar surface habitat."
221,"The iss is a complex environment that serves as an astronaut home, workplace, and transportation environment. The goal of this study is to determine similarities and differences between microbial communities and growth under elevated moisture conditions in occupied spaces on earth and the iss. This study also provides insight into how microbial communities will react to unintended conditions such as a ventilation system failure or fire suppression event."
222,"This study aims to understand the differences between the indoor microbiomes of earth - based residential buildings and dust collected from the international space station. dust samples were obtained from vacuum bags ( celoc hypo - allergenic filter system oreck # pkbb12dw ) from the vacuum onboard which the astronauts use to clean the hepa filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. fungal and bacterial dna was extracted from these incubated samples, sequenced with illumina miseq, and analyzed with a bioinformatics pipeline to determine taxonomy."
223," earth and iss samples were exposed to varying elevated erh conditions using the time - of - wetness framework previously outlined 20. earth samples were analyzed at day 0, 5, 10, and 14 after vacuuming approximately 50 mg of dust from carpet squares 20. iss dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25 mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. we do not anticipate any significant impact with the carpet and iss dust as they are very similar in structure due the linty, fibrous nature of the iss dust."
224," differential abundance analyses used total fungal and bacterial quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qpcr ) values measure at the kingdom level as previously described 11, 20. to quantify fungal concentration, we targeted the 18s rrna gene with forward primer ( ff2 ) 5 ’ - ggttctattttgttggt ttcta - 3 ’, and reverse primer ( fr1 ) 5’ - ctctcaatctgtcaatccttatt – 3 ′ 36. for bacteria we targeted 16s rRna. gene with. forward primer 5 ‘ - tcctacgggaggcagcagt - 3"
225,"For fungi and bacteria, primers and spacers were trimmed using the cutadapt plug - in 40. sequences were then quality trimmed to a phred score of 30 with a 3 low - quality base window using the quality - filter plugin 42. fungal sequences were clustered using the vsearch open reference method with unite database reference sequences ( version 9. 0 ) 43, 44, while bacterial sequences were quality checked using dada2 45 and clustered by phylogeny. beta diversity metrics for fungi were analyzed using bray – curtis dissimilarity while bacteria utilized unweighted and weighted unifrac statistics."
226,"All relative abundance data was transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function and combined with qpcr quantities to produce an absolute abundance value. species that did not occur in at least 10 % of all samples were removed before analysis 20, 49, 50. ( fdr ) was used instead of positive false discovery rate ( pfdr ) due to the relatively small sample size 49."
227,"We compared fungal communities in dust from the iss and earth - based residential homes. epicoccum, alternaria, pseudopithomyces, and cladosporium were the dominant fungal genera on earth while aspergillus, cyberlindnera, rhodotorula, and candida were more abundant on the iss. The earth samples were much more diverse compared to iss samples."
228,"Earth original dust samples had a mean fungal otu count of 465, while the iss dust had amean of only 102 otus ( table s2 ). alpha diversity also showed significant differences in richness and shannon diversity metrics when comparing earth. to iss samples. fungal communities of all combined varying erh samples also varied based on location."
229,"Fungal community composition differences between earth and iss samples. earth - based samples were more diverse than iss dust for all conditions. Both locations generally became less diverse as erh and time elevated increased. for all time points at varying elevated conditions ( 85 % erh), on earth there was an average of 462 otus while on the iss there were 95 otus ( table s2 ). this was also true for all times elevated above saturated conditions."
230,"Bacterial diversity was much higher on earth with 237 bacterial asvs compared to 102 on the iss. bacterial community composition also different between earth and iss samples. bacterial beta diversity for original dust samples visually separated by location, but due to low sample size statistical significance was not able to be determined."
231,"Bacterial richness and shannon diversity plots for time of wetness samples comparing earth - based house dust to dust collected from the iss. bacterial alpha diversity was also significantly different for time - of - wetness. samples between these locations for both richness ( richness h = 11. 38, p = 0. 0001 ) and Shannon diversity ( h = 9. 79, p < 0.0018 ) ( fig. 4 b, table s6 ). again, for these samples earth samples were more diverse with 104 bacterial asvs while only 53 in iss dust ( table s2 ). a limited bacterial differential abundance analysis was performed on original dust samples only."
232,"cillaceae becoming most abundant at 100 % erh. for iss samples corynebacteriaceae, staphylococcaceae, streptoccoceae, and pseudomonadaceae are most abundant bacterial families. 50 %, 85 %, and 100% erh samples were from day 14 only and were also the average of 4 earth - based homes and 4 iss vacuum bags."
233,"There are clear differences in bacterial and fungal communities in dust collected from earth - based residential homes and from the iss. These difference were more pronounced in fungi, especially under elevated moisture conditions. These differences may be attributed to the unique stressors faced by microbes during spaceflight conditions such as microgravity."
234,"Earth dust samples were incubated embedded in carpet and vacuumed again before molecular analysis, while iss samples were not. The microbiome of dust from earth is more diverse than that of the iss. These community differences result in changes in microbial growth upon exposure to moisture that may be associated with health impacts. This understanding can help us to maintain a healthy indoor microbiome on spacecraft during increased activity in low - earth orbit and long duration human - occupied space travel."
235,"The human cell atlas project aims to spatially map all cell types in the human body. We propose that a parallel human cell space atlas could serve as an openly available, global resource for space life science research. as humanity becomes increasingly spacefaring, high - resolution omics on orbit could permit an advent of precision spaceflight healthcare."
236,"Since the inception of human spaceflight, the duration that astronauts spend in space each mission has increased over time. to date, only eleven individuals have resided in space for more than 300 consecutive days. pioneering crewed missions to mars would see humans embarking through space for even longer consecutive periods of time and in radiation environments for which there is limited knowledge about the impact on human physiology."
237,"The average time spent in space ranged from minutes to one month in the 1960s, and from one day to under six months in the 1970s. In the early 2020s, there was the widest distribution of average time in space, ranging from ten minutes to six months. nations with only one astronaut to ever go to space are colored green ( 4%) while nations with between two and five astronauts are colored lime green ( 3%)"
238,"Omics are a potential biomedical research platform that may one day translate into the development of precision spaceflight healthcare. space omics efforts are now underway in multiple regions. in japan, the “ living in space ” grant - in - aid for scientific research ( kakenhi ) program uncovers biological responses to the space environment at various levels."
239,"Nations like canada, china, france, germany, italy, japan, and russia have also been represented to a moderate degree ( fig. 1b ). individuals who have entered space now represent, even if in smaller numbers, more than thirty other nations. upcoming planetary missions will likely be multinational efforts, underscoring the need for global collaboration."
240,"In the coming years, the spaceflight field will likely observe diversification of the flying population, extended mission durations, and exposure to harsher radiation beyond leo. These factors motivate an upgraded space healthcare model where nutritional, supplemental, and pharmaceutical decisions could be tailored to multiple characteristics. The purpose of customizing spaceflight healthcare would not be to reduce spaceflight participation, but to promote the health of increasingly diverse participation."
241,The provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health - related importance. Scientists must cautiously avoid overassociating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. We emphasize that the following section mostly presents early evidence and even contradictions due to the current limitations of the human space omics field.
242," metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how to better understand precision responses to such drugs. a recent pharmacogenetics study by the esa demonstrated that allelic variation may influence the safety and effectiveness of how individual crew members metabolize drugs on the iss."
243,"Astronauts could assess their pre - mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents ( such as glutathione, glycine, cysteine, arginine, and taurine ) to inform their optimum conditions. One concrete example of how cyp allelic variants could inform treatments during space exploration relates to acute radiation sickness."
244,"Metabolism of medications may be altered in spaceflight compared to on earth. kidneys, which play a major role in drug excretion, may reduce urine output during weightlessness. liver, which is the main organ that metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, may also behave differently between terrestrial and spaceflight conditions."
245,"Common variations in one - carbon metabolism genes, combined with lower levels of vitamins b2, b6, and b9, appeared to be associated with poor neuro - ocular health. disordered one- carbon metabolism may play a role in bone fragility, hypertension, and chromosome instability."
246,"Vitamin d is well - known for its influence on bone production, it impacts several more biological processes, including immune system modulation. poor vitamin d status and metabolism of individuals during space missions might negatively affect the immune systems of astronauts. this could potentially be mitigated through precision omics profiles. to dna repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles."
247,"Jaxa is currently conducting human liquid biopsy studies on the iss. The main purpose of the studies is to investigate how the space environment affects humans at the tissue level. liquid biopsies can detect cell - free components ( microrna, rna, dna, and extracellular vesicles ) in the blood and scientists can estimate which tissues they are derived from."
248,"The feasibility of orbital sampling and readout can be explored for various biological sources, such as saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and nasal discharge. metadata parameters that should be collected from humans include environment, diet, nutrition, psychosocial dynamics, lifestyle, medical history, anthropometrics, and phenotypes."
249,"To obtain a thorough understanding of the complex dynamics that spaceflight causes in humans, there is a need to increase the analysis resolution level. higher in resolution could enable the generation of cell space atlases, which could further push forward a developing field of precision space healthcare. civilian missions may greatly contribute to advancing the spaceflight omics field, given that many commercial spaceflight participants have expressed voluntary interest."
250,"A plant, mouse, and human cell space atlas could improve our understanding of how each system responds to spaceflight and hence enhance health monitoring capabilities during prolonged space missions. having access to the different changes occurring at the spatial cell type level in key organs would allow researchers to better understand how cell - cell interactions are altered by spaceflight."
251,Tissue chips ( organs on chips ) could be viable options for high - resolution space omics studies. real human tissues can also be studied in spaceflight following protocols similar to the suture in space initiative. personalized chips and tissues could also be exposed to extreme environments before missions to assess individual risks.
252,"The generation and usage of human space omics data poses considerable ethical, cultural, and legal challenges that would need to be carefully resolved through policy development. The current rarity of human omics collection and curation can be viewed as a barrier to the development and deployment of emerging space - based health technologies, including precision healthcare."
253,"Human omics research is an emerging area for spaceflight 79, 80, 59, this is just part of the bigger picture of space ethics 81, and human omicsResearch on earth 82. policies pertaining to the collection, storage, and usage of omics data from consenting astronauts and spaceflight participants would need to be carefully balanced. thorough discussion amongst international ethicists could ensure that such policies are designed such that they are not so restrictive."
254,"The value of open - science has recently been demonstrated through a large - scale multi - omics analysis comparing datasets from the nasa genelab biorepository. The data can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. limiting accessibility to human space omics data creates a barrier to analysis efforts. Every decrement from complete open access reduces the scientific utility of the data."
255,Ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population. privacy breaches would involve disclosure of this data against the will of the participants. policies may be considered overly permissible if they fail to account for the risks of identifiability from the full range of omic data types and data formats.
256,"In the united states, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions. However, nasa is not a branch of the military, so it is subject to the genetic information nondiscrimination act 2008. Even with precision medicine approaches, sending an individual with a genetic predisposition to spaceflight - associated risks may still increase the likelihood of a serious medical incident."
257,Policymaking for human space omics should be considered as a balancing act between developing policies that are not so overly restrictive that they limit the scientific potential of the data. policies would be seen as overly permissible if they do not factor in the risk of incidental findings and fail to implement appropriate and clear procedures for disclosure and genetic counseling.
258,"International collaboration in human spaceflight research will be crucial. Data sanitization methods can manipulate the data to reduce the risk of identification. federated approaches, such as federating learning for training ai models without moving the data across jurisdictions, could prove useful. Data should be as “ as open as possible, as closed as necessary ”, in order to maximize scientific utility while protecting the rights of the participants."
259," broad consent has been proposed as a potential solution to gain consent in the context of omics research. discussions regarding the development of appropriate policies need to commence early, so that anticipatory policies are ready as the science is ready. issop, with its international membership and links to nasa genelab and the esa space omics topical team, is well positioned to help guide standardization of policy."
260," frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. We leveraged murine data obtained from nasa ’ s genelab, along with astronaut data gathered from the jaxa and inspiration4 missions. We identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty - like condition during space missions."
261,"Microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement are major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system. The molecular mechanisms of spaceflight - related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging : mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes. as a defined set of aging - related molecular changes, the hallmark of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology."
262," frailty, a recent concept in aging science, can be defined as a syndrome caused by the combined effect of numerous age - related alterations. part of the deconditioning of human physiology caused by spaceflight resembles the features of frail patients. The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging ’ s biological pathways."
263,"The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging ’ s biological pathways, which could be elicited by the space environment. here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts."
264,"All murine data were obtained from nasa open science data repository ( former genelab ), where they were previously collected and shared by other investigators. blood samples were provided by spacex inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the irb at the weill cornell medicine."

272," inspiration4 ( i4 ) sample collection was the world ’ s first all - civilian mission to orbit earth. four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in low - earth orbit ( leo ) at 585 km above earth. several human related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance."
273,"i4 crews ’ physiological changes were monitored with ultrasound scanning, molecular diagnostics devices, smartwatch wearables devices, and etc. infection or inflammation are the most prevalent clinical symptoms found during the long - term ( around 6 months ) spaceflight 92. Two astronauts presented with space motion sickness, although most metrics were either stable, or quickly reverted back to baseline after landing."
274,The short gene list of predictors of sarcopenia was obtained by analyzing a population of age matched individuals with and without the disease. This list contains 21 genes that can predict sarc Openia in patients with an accuracy > 75%. The heatmaps were made for the frailty genes on the normalized values per time point using r package pheatmap version 1. 0. 12.
275, metabolic model initially optimized for nad biosynthesis whose capacity through all pathways of human was computed by estimating optimized ‘ nad sink ’ reaction flux level. ‘ oxidative phosphorylation ’ and ‘ citric acid cycle ’ were not included in the essential pathways to take into account mitochondrial dysregulation.
276,"To determine the impact of frailty during spaceflight, we constructed, based on previous literature 19 – 22, a list of putative frailty biomarker genes for humans and mice. mouse ( osd - 21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105 ) datasets from osdr were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes ( degs ) in flight versus control condition with a statistical cut - off of adjusted p - value < 0. 5. In mice, altered expression of. frailty - related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius ( 34 genes in o SD - 21 and 8 genes in. oSD - 101 ) ; extensor digitorum"
277,"The transcriptomic signature of spaceflight is investigated with differential expression analysis in multiple tissues. rodent datasets showed a general enrichment of the pathways with an overall upregulation in edl and tibialis anterior, downregulation in quadriceps, and a mixed regulation in gastrocnemius soleus. Despite a mixed direction of regulation, a clear enrichment of these pathways in the spaceflight group when compared to the control was evident across the datasets. the increase in immune and inflammatory signatures we identified is consistent with various reports that associate chronic inflammation with frailty, although causality has yet to be established."
278,Inflammatory response pathways are enriched in rodent muscles during spaceflight. The increase in immune and inflammatory signatures we identified is consistent with various reports that associate chronic inflammation with frailty. The best predictors of sarcopenia were genes that are part of autophagic and protein degradation processes.
279,"We found that eight of the biomarkers identified for frailty had the ability to predict sarcopenia in gse111006, gse 111010, andgse111016 with a mean accuracy score ( mas ) of > 0. 65. The same was true for molecular functions ( mf ) go term enrichment."
280,"Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in human muscles during spaceflight. We found that only gjb4, hnrnpcl1, golga2 and pomc were degs in at least one of the datasets. The dataset from the soleus muscle in mice ( osd - 104 ), demonstrated to have a significant overexpression of these genes."
281,"The transcriptomic signature of spaceflight is investigated with differential expression analysis in multiple tissues. approximately a third of the frailty genes were conserved between humans and mice, which suggests that the murine models can provide good translation to human biology. out of 73 differentially expressed frailty - related genes, 22 ( 32 % ) were common in human and mice ( fig. 5 b ). forty - three ( 62%) of the genes were unique to mice and 4 ( 6%) unique to only humans."
282,Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts. our rna analysis reveals a global response of frailty - related gene expression to the space environment. most of the genes investigated were subject to changes when compared to pre - flight conditions. a large number of genes that were reduced during spaceflight showed an increase after re - entry.
283,"The data suggest that space conditions alter the hif1 pathway which stimulates the various molecular or cellular processes related to hypoxia. Cell - free rnas from several genes ( e. g,. fgf23, krt18, akt1, b2m, nos1, aoc1, sod2 and sod3 ) did not return to the pre - flight baseline levels, even after 120 days."
284,"Akt1 plays a role in the signal transduction of growth factors, cell survival, cellular senescence, and aging. chronic akt activation intensified aging - induced cardiac hypertrophy in murine heart tissues. fgf23 is known to be secreted from the skeletal system and influence the kidneys through the klotho gene receptor. nos3 is expressed by endothelial cells and is implicated with the formation and maintenance of vascularized tissues."
285,"Fig. 7 frailty - related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts exposed to 3 - days of low earth orbit spaceflight. frailty linked genes from inspiration4 ( i4 ) human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs) included egfr trafficking ( atxn2), regulators of apoptosis ( bcl2l1, fas), survival factor for neuronal cell types ( cntf), cell – cell signaling ( jag1), metabolism ( ppard), dna repair ( rev1), neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission ( snx14)"
286,"Fig. 8 metabolic flux simulation analysis on osd - 91 and oSD - 127. genes in the boxes are enzymes showing significantly different expressions for their corresponding reactions. in tk6 lymphoblastoid cells, microgravity led to transcriptional changes through altered methylation patterns. these transcriptional Changes altered the oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism pathways 48."
287,"Cardiomyocyte study using 3d tissue engineering of cardiac progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells found increased gene expression levels associated with growth, development, and survival in microgravity 49. The only significant downregulation was detected in folate metabolism. The cells exhibited increased galactose metabolism, nucleotide interconversion, coenzyme a ( coa ) synthesis, glutathione metabolism, as well as pentose phosphate pathway in carbohydrate metabolism."
288,"No prior links to frailty - like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight. These markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. We propose the use of omics data to investigate the development of aging - like phenomena in spaceflight, which can also help improve our understanding of aging metrics like clonal hematopoiesis."
289,"We examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging - related pathways to a different extent depending on the tissue. We also found changes in expression of putatives frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during space flight."
290,Short - duration spaceflight data such as those provided by the i4 mission are also relevant to detect early signs of frailty development. genome sequencing onboard the iss is currently used in the microbiological monitoring program. Future studies aimed at establishing such a validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation.
291,A validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in - and post - flight. The establishment and validation of such a panel could either be done by correlating with physiological measures already captured by nasa ’ s standard measures program or by adapting from the emerging frailty indexes.
292,"Altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. radiation exposure could play a role in the development of radiation - induced cardiovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways. microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue. muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging."
293," muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. it is also thought to contribute to frailty. in humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic."
294,"In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted a diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. pursuing the development of biobanks for multi - omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research."
295,The environment in space activates a diverse set of genes involved in regulating fundamental cellular pathways. This includes the activation of genes associated with blood homeostasis and erythropoiesis. haemoglobin biology provides an intriguing model for studying space omics. Study sheds light on the dynamic nature of globin gene regulation in response to the space environment.
296,"Astronauts experience a reduction in their red blood cell mass, associated with anaemia, which is however resolved after a few months back on earth. The mechanism behind the incidence of space anaemia is still unknown. The full astronaut blood, as well as transcriptional data from the nasa twins study 9, 10 was analysed for the globin gene expression profile."
297,"Full astronaut blood, as well as transcriptional data from the nasa twins study 9, 10 was analysed for the globin gene expression profile. The research uncovered two important conclusions. firstly, exposing humans to orbiter effects resulted in a significantly down - regulated expression of all globin genes, seemingly confirming space anaemia."
298,"Nasa twins study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. flight twin spent 340 days aboard the iss while his identical twin stayed on earth as the ground control. blood samples were collected into 4 ml cpt tubes ( bd biosciences cat no. 362760 ) as per the manufacturer ’ s recommendations. cell separation was performed by centrifugation at 1800 × g for 20 min at room temperature, both on the iss and for the ground - based samples."
299," cells were loaded onto 3 bd rhapsody nanowell cartridges. cartridges were loaded with cell capture beads ( bd biosciences ) before shaking for 15 s at 1000 rpm. These cells were then isolated using the single - cell analysis system and cdna synthesis. library dna concentration was quantified using a qubit dsdna hs kit ( thermofisher, no. q32854 ) on a qu bit fluorometer."
300,"Small rna libraries were prepared from 50ng total rna using the nebnext multiplex small rna library prep set for illumina ( neb no. e7560 ) per manufacturer ’ s recommendations. heatmaps were made for the curated globin genes on the deg values per time point using the r package pheatmap version 1. 0. 12. for flight - only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples."
301,"Blood samples were collected from 6 astronauts before, during, and after the spaceflight on the iss. mean expression values were obtained from normalised read counts of 6 astronauts for each time point. heatmaps were computed for the curated globin genes on the normalised values per time point using the r package pheatmap version 1. 0. 12. differential expression analysis was carried out with deseq2, and subsequent volcano plots were plotted."
302,"All human astronaut subjects have consented at an informed consent briefing ( icb ) at spacex ( hawthorne, ca ), and samples were collected and processed under the approval of the institutional review board ( irb) at weill cornell medicine, under protocol 21 - 05023569. jaxa and nasa astronaut data dissemination follows agency protocols. further information on research design is available in the nature portfolio reporting summary linked to this article."
303,"Results from the nasa twins study, the jaxa study as well as the inspiration4 mission. a summary of observed trends is provided in fig. 1. erythropoiesis promoters showed a mixed in - flight and post - flight expression regulation, with some promoters down - regulated in flight and thus likely contributing to the space anaemia phenotype."
304,"Fig. 2 diagram showcasing comparisons in expression, for a number of different cellular fractions, in the nasa twins study. genes and tfs in cellular fractions that showed a higher level of differentially expressed significance, with a p - value < 0. 05 are separately indicated. values showcased in these diagrams represent mean expression levels measured across the jaxa cohort."
305," expression values were obtained before, during and after spaceflight, at specific intervals, for the jaxa astronaut cohort. genes and trans - acting factors considered were those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and / or erythropoiesis. genes of interest were labelled accordingly if found to be significantly up - regulated or down - regulated. obtained differential expression values show that epo ( epo ) was significantly down -regulated in - flight, when compared to pre - flight levels, but then up -regulated again post - flight."
306," principal component analysis ( pca ) was carried out accordingly for the jaxa astronauts. pca was performed across different features ( normalised gene expressions ), grouping astronaut sample data into before, during and after flight groups. The features considered are genes of interest, that is genes known to be involved in erythropoiesis, haematopoiedis and the globin gene switch."
307,"A diagram of normalised expression levels is provided for the inspiration4 crew in fig. 6. expression values are only available pre - flight and post - flight, with no in - flight measurement data available. The cellular type here assessed constitutes the peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) cellular fraction. separation by flight status is visible in the pc1 vs pc2 plots for both globin genes ( bottom ) and trans - acting factors ( top ). source data for the figure is provided in the source data file."
308,Fig. 8 pca plot showcasing separation between pre - flight and post - flight samples for the plasma cell - free samples from the inspiration4 crew. genes and trans - acting factors showcased are those known to be involved in the globin gene switch mechanism and / or erythropoiesis. source data for the figure is provided in the source data file.
309,"Fig. 9 shows normalised values of globin mirna expression in the nasa twins study. fig. 10 shows a number of physiological parameters for a cohort of astronauts from across multiple missions. The figure indicates levels of different parameters before, during and after flight and also denotes the sample size for every reading, as showcased by the included legend. In particular, measured red blood cell counts showcase the advent of space anaemia."
310,"In both the nasa twins study and for the inspiration4 crew, specific blood cellular fractions were separately analysed for expression of different genes. The ld and cpt fractions were considered to be most relevant for investigation of alpha and beta - globin gene expression. These fractions are expected to contain the erythroid blood component."
311,"In microgravity, astronauts experience a decrease in red blood cells, possibly due to bone mineral density loss 12, 13. this space - induced mild anaemia is intriguing for understanding mechanisms seen in clinical anaemia. the research looked into genes involved in haemoglobin production, noting similarities between astronaut and clinical anaemic in blood cell count changes."
312,"Mutations in the hba1 and hba2 gene in patients is normally manifested as alpha - thalassaemia, an inherited disorder that can range in severity from mild form of anaemia to very severe anaemia. In the jaxa cohort, the hbb gene shows a reduction in expression observed during flight, followed by an increase in expression post - flight."
313,"Hbg1 and hbg2 in the nasa twins study showed down - regulation when compared to pre - flight and post - flight levels. for hbe1, a similar up - regulation in flight was observed in both the jaxa astronaut cohort and in the  nasa twin study. the alas2 gene was found to be heavily up - regulated immediately after the jAXa astronauts ’ return. the gene is involved in the development stage for erythroblasts."
314,The e2f2 gene is a known negative regulator of haem oxygenase - 1 ( ho - 1 ) - with enhanced expression of e2 f2 resulting in lowered ho 1 levels and vice versa. reduced expression of this gene is particularly observed in diamond blackfan anaemia. flvcr1 was shown to have perturbed expression with phases of up - regulation observed both in - flight and post - flight in the jaxa cohort.
315,"Several genes can have several transcription factors affecting their expression, directly or indirectly. specific regions of the genome, referred to as cis - acting or trans - acting elements and resulting in the promotion or repression of other genes. while both mbd2 and mbd3 were found to be down - regulated during normal erythropoiesis in murine model bone marrow. down - regulation in bcl11a was also noted in flight for the jaxa astronauts. this suggests a reaction to the increased rate of haemolysis known to be experienced in flight."
316," bcl11a and sox6 expression was reduced in flight, due to space anaemia, to allow the increased expression of gamma - globin. zbtb7a, another known down - regulator for gamma - globein gene expression, was also down - regulated in flight. sin3a was found to be down -regulated in flight in the jaxa astronaut cohort as well as in the nasa twins study. nr2c2 expression levels were also observed to decrease, which further seems to point towards an overall shift towards the expression of fetal haemoglobin."
317,"Nr2c2 is known to be a direct transcriptional repressor of both embryonic and fetal haemoglobin 33 – 35. Down - regulation of chd4 was noted during flight for the jaxa cohort, following up - regulation to pre - flight levels after return to earth. This follows the other observations made in the same astronaut cohort concerning bcl11a and klf1."
318," observations of expression of the myb gene showed an overall reduction in expression in flight and a somewhat increased expression post - flight for the jaxa astronauts. myb is known to support erythropoiesis through activation of klf1 and lmo2 expression. epo was found to be significantly down - regulated in - flight and up - regulated post- flight in the jAXa cohort, but remaining mostly at stable levels in the inspiration4 study."
319,"The atf4 gene itself was found to be down - regulated post - flight, when compared to in - flight levels, for both the jaxa cohort and in the nasa twins study. other genes known to be heavily involved in erythropoietic pathways showed notable variation. particularly, the acvr1b gene showed significant down - regulation in -Flight and up - regulation post -Flight."
320,The expression of ldb1 was observed to undergo up - regulation in - flight when compared with both pre - flight and post - flight levels in the nasa twins study data. The increased expression of arid1b in flight might have also had a delayed response in increased gata1 expression ( observed post -flight ) and thus amelioration of astronauts post- flight could be in part attributed to the observed gata 1 up -regulation.
321,"Nfe2 is involved in the activation of pbgd 49 and fech 50, two enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis. this suggests that the up - regulation of nfe2 may be an in - flight response to counter space anaemia. globin mirnas have also been shown to play a role in the switch between embryonic and fetal haemoglobin, as well as the regulation of adult globin."
322,The mirnas may indeed play a significant role in the observed globin gene expression values provided in fig. fig : expression _ mirnas _ nasa. recorded post - flight. The down - regulation of investigated mirnas in the erythroid fractions coincides with the down - Regulation of expression of adult globin genes on the alpha and beta - globin loci.
323,"Fetal haemoglobin expression is favoured in flight, as seen in several hahemoglobinopathies. This suggests that the observed in - flight switch may be a similar mechanism, in this case, to combat the effects of space anaemia. in addition, a number of genes that play a role in erythropoiesis were also found to be perturbed in flight."
324,"The hostile spaceflight environment can induce a wide range of increased health risks, including dermatological issues. The biology driving the frequency of skin issues in astronauts is currently not well understood. Changes in the activation of genes related to damage to dna, skin barrier health, and mitochondria may play a role in these skin problems."
325," dermatological issues are not typically regarded as a key risk to astronaut health and mission success, yet they are amongst the most common in - flight health issues reported by astronauts. during regular international space station ( iss ) missions averaging 6 - months, skin rashes have been identified as the most frequently reported clinical symptom. as the human body ’ s largest organ, the skin plays a crucial role in numerous essential health functions."
326,"Portunistic microorganisms on astronaut skin may stem from the unusual hygiene procedures on the iss. While these microbiome shifts and their associated health effects require further studies, investigations into the molecular response of skin tissue in space are lacking. In this study, we perform an analysis of five previously unreported murine skin rna - seq datasets from the jaxa mouse habitat unit 2 ( mhu - 2 ) 18, nasa rodent research 5 ( rr - 5 ) and 7 (rr - 7 ) experiments. We use an explainable artificial intelligence ( ai ) modeling approach to construct interpretable machine learning models."
327,"In addition to examining gene regulatory patterns, we use an explainable artificial intelligence ( ai ) modeling approach. We identify synergistic effects between pairs of genes, which we interpret as possible biological interactions. We then investigate gene regulatory changes observed in the rodent skin data in astronaut data, including jaxa hair follicle data 13, skin data from the i4 mission."
328,"We used a systems biology approach utilizing nasa ’ s open science data repository ( osdr ) on space flown murine transcriptomic datasets. We focused on the skin, biochemical profiles of 50 nasa astronauts and human transcriptomic dataset generated from blood and hair samples of jaxa astronauts. We also used blood samples obtained from the nasa twins study, and skin and blood samples from the first civilian commercial mission, inspiration4."
329," datasets are derived from whole murine skin samples from the mhu - 2, rr - 5, and rR - 7 spaceflight experiments. Data were downloaded from the nasa osdr via the api, and full dataset descriptions can be found on the dataset pages. differential gene expression ( dge ) analysis using the wald significance test was performed on spaceflight microgravity and ground control samples. mapping of mouse ensembl gene ids to gene symbols and human orthologs was done using the r package biomart."
330,"For over representation analysis ( ora), the r package clusterprofiler ( v4. 8. 3 ) was used on vectors of genes. msigdb human collections h, c2, and c5 were used ( v7. 4 ) and set sizes > 15 were permitted. for the mitochondrial pathway analysis, human pathways from mitopathways ( v3. 0 ), with some additional custom curated pathways ( supplementary table 1 ), were used. longitudinal samples were collected from a male astronaut aboard the iss and his identical twin on earth during a 340 day mission including 6 months preflight and 6 months postflight follow - up."
331,"Rna extraction, library prep and sequencing were completed per 19 using both ribodepletion or polya selection kits. lymphocyte depleted ( ld ) fraction. samples collected on earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. to correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on rna ( approximately 36 h including landing and repatriation ) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return."
332,"The inspiration4 ( i4 ) astronaut sample collection four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in low - earth orbit ( leo ) at 585 km above earth. All biological data derived from the inspiration4 mission were collected pre - and post - flight, and will be accessible via the space omics and medical atlas ( soma ) 27. for this study, only data from blood samples and skin biopsies were used."
333,All human studies were done with ethical approvals with established and approved irbs at weill cornell medicine. blood samples were provided by spacex inspiration4 crew members after consent for research use. experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the irb.
334,"As of this writing, data were available for 59 crewmembers ( 47 male, 12 female ). age at launch was 47. 0 ± 5. 6 y, body mass at launchwas 79. 2 ± 11. 8 kg ( m : 83. 3 ± 9. 3 ; f : 63. 0± 4. 5 ). body mass index was 25. 5 ± 2. 9 kg / m2. all protocols were reviewed and approved by the nasa institutional review board and all subjects provided written informed consent."
335,"All available data are reported here, although the reported n for any given test or session varies for a number of reasons. repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight. comparisons among time points were made using a bonferroni t - test. multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p < 0. 001 are reported. the data was plotted using r package ggplot2 ( v3. 3. 5 )."
336,Umap dimensional reduction and gene clustering for the clustering of genes shown in fig. 1b. We performed a uniqueness filtering by first dropping all genes where more than a quarter of the samples had identical expression levels. genes were then clustered using the hierarchical density - based spatial clustering.
337,"We used the elsevier pathway collection, the 2021 wikipathway collection, and the 2021 mgi mammalian phenotype level 4 collection. We used the differential gene expression data from all cross - mission genes across each comparison to perform an upstream regulator analysis. We identified the biological or chemical drugs in the qiagen ipa library of regulators, defined as having a benjamini – hochberg adjusted p value < 0. 05 and an absolute z - score > 1. drugs from the dataset that met these criteria and were associated with similar log 2 fold - change patterns."
338,"We analyzed five rna - seq datasets from the nasa open science data repository ( osdr ) 40, all representing skin tissue from space flown mice and matching ground control replicates. The most variable genes across the datasets cluster into functional groups related to established physiological risks of spaceflight. In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes ( degs ) are significant."
339,"In total 476 unique differentially expressed genes ( degs ) are significant ( false discovery rate ( fdr ) ≤ 0. 1 ) in at least 2 out of the 10 data subsets. glycam1, a ligand for l - selectin that has been proposed to modulate leukocyte transendothelial migration from blood 44, is strongly upregulated ( log 2 fold change ( lfc ) ≈ 18. 81, fdr < 10 −6 ) at the 25 day time point and strongly downregulated at the 75 day point."
340,"To address the previously mentioned bias in the mhu - 2 dorsal skin data subset with a fos - supplemented diet, and to delineate the common response of murine skin to spaceflight across multiple datasets, a list of 189 differentially expressed genes ( degs ) is generated exhibiting significance ( false discovery rate ≤0.1 ) in data subsets from at least two distinct missions. for the majority of the significant degs, there is a trend of downregulation in themhu -2 dorsal skin dataset with the fos- supplemented diet. A smaller cluster of genes ( e. g., lama1, s1pr1, hmgcs2, txnip,"
341,"The 189 cross - mission degs are primarily involved in cell - cycle pathways. Several of the genes ( e. g. lama1, c1qtnf9, hmgcs2, txnip, klf11 ) clustering with average trends of upregulation across the datasets. these genes tend also to be involved in metabolic pathways, particularly those associated with diabetes. to go beyond single - gene significance, we use qlattice modeling to construct models that predict the spaceflight status of all samples in the data."
342," c1qtnf9 ( also known as ctrp9 ) has also emerged as a potentially important component of pathways involving lipid metabolism and adipose tissue. sphingosine - 1 - phosphate ( s1p ) - sphingo- phosphate receptor (s1pr ) axis have been implicated in pathogenesis of both inflammatory and autoimmune skin diseases. oxtr, identified as a key driver in the most predictive 2 - gene qlattice model, is predominantly localized in the basal layer of the epidermis."
343,"We used post - flight vs pre - flight gene expression data from skin samples collected during the i4 mission. astronaut data correlates with select gene expression changes occurring across missions in the murine skin models. flg and casp14, which play significant roles in skin barrier formation, are also downregulated in the epidermis of i4 astronauts."
344,"We also analyze gene expression data from the blood of astronauts from the nasa twins, jaxa cfe studies, and i4 studies. tyr, dct, and tyrp1 clustered in the rodent data, with an average trend of downregulation, particularly in the mhu - 2 dorsal skin dataset with the fos - supplemented diet. oxtr is upregulated across all compartments studied in the i4 skin ( fig. 4a ) and hsd17b11 is up regulated in both compartments of the epidermis and in the outer dermis."
345,"In the cfe study, several genes were strongly upregulated in - flight and then downregulated post - flight ( e. g., oxtr, prr9, ercc6l ) in the blood samples from jaxa astronauts. The majority of genes show a pronounced suppression in the time point immediately before flight, which could be indicative of increased stress prior to launch."
346,"A collagen biosynthesis pathway and a set of collagen genes were significantly ( fdr ≤ 0. 1 ) suppressed / downregulated across all dataset subsets for the mhu - 2 mission. While there is a general trend of upregulation, the rr - 5 mission generally lacks any significant results for genes relating to skin health, which could be due to the 30 days of recovery post - flight."
347,"Fig. 5 behavior of the specific genes associated with skin health in astronauts and rodents. in addition to being reported as cross - mission genes in the previous section, casp14, flg and krt2 were also identified as key skin health genes. in post - flight vs. pre - flight skin samples from the i4 mission, several collagen / ecm genes were downregulated across the whole dermis. mmp3, which induces accelerated loss of skin collagen when there is inflammation, was upregulated across dermal layer 65."
348,Krt24 is upregulated in all compartments of the skin with a more prominent increase in outer epidermis and vascular layers 66. Late cornified envelope genes ( lce ) are located in the epidermal differentiation complex on chromosome 1. genes that respond to uv and calcium 67 and lce5a were upregulated post - flight vs pre - flight ( fig. 5b ).
349,"weak in - flight downregulation was followed by strong post - flight upregulation for lce2c and krt33a. col6a2 and fkbp14, a collagen / ecm related gene associated with diseases such as kyphoscoliotic ehlers - danlos syndrome, were also downregulated. pathways relating to dna damage and repair are generally enriched, while being suppressed in other data subsets. balb / c and c3h / hej mice are more radiosensitive compared to c57bl / 6j mice."
350,In the c3h / hej mice there is a trend of decreasing activity for the ddr pathways from the 25 - day to 75 - day time points. This could indicate either adaptation of the dna repair pathways over time in space or dysregulation following extended - duration spaceflight. mitochondrial dysregulation increased in the skin during spaceflight mitochondrial stress has been identified as a key hub for spaceflight response in multi - tissue analysis.
351,"One of the 10 strongest 2 - feature models involved the expression of the genes d2hgdh ( d - 2 - hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase ) 80 and rplp0 - ps1 ( a gene coding for the ribosomal protein rPLp0 ). The model indicates an increased removal of the toxic d2H compound in mitochondria through upregulation of d2 hgdh. We investigated standard physiological biomarkers collected from astronaut urine and blood 81, 82 to see whether average trends in these biomarkers connect to spaceflight gene regulatory changes."
352,Vitamin d is well - established to be an important mediator of skin health 83. This decrease in vitamin d is observed despite consistent programmatic vitamin d supplementation since the collection of blood samples 81. spaceflight - induced gene regulatory changes in the skin correlate with relevant drug responses. We then investigate potential drug targets and mechanisms for these genes via ingenuity pathway analysis ( ipa ) ( fig. 9 ).
353,"Several drugs were predicted to exhibit significant positive correlation with gene expression changes seen in the space flown mice. l - asparaginase showed the strongest correlation. with gene regulatory changes in these spaceflight - exposed mice associated with use of the vitamin a derivative tretinoin ( all - trans retinoic acid ) 90, and two selective estrogen receptor modulators, tamoxifen and 4 - hydroxytamox ifen 91 – 94."
354," estrogen and diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen, showed a reversed pattern compared to the aforementioned drug targets ( fig. 9 ). These drugs showed positive correlation with the expression changes in the rr - 5 datasets, and negative correlation in the other data subsets."
355,"Despite the frequency of dermatological issues in astronauts 2, the molecular response of skin to spaceflight is understudied. here, we have performed a comprehensive study on the molecular impact of spaceflight on skin. our analysis indicated intriguing gene regulatory changes occurring in the skin of space flight vs ground control mice. The genes exhibiting the highest variability across the datasets formed clusters associated with well - established physiological risks of spaceFlight."
356,"We observed the counteractive mechanism played by d2hgdh, which was generally upregulated in space flown mice ( fig. 7b ) indicating an increased need for breakdown of toxic d - 2 - hydroxyglutarate molecules in mitochondria. in this model, the partner gene rplp0 - ps1 codes for the ribosomal protein rPLp0 and is down - regulated in space flew mice. if this occurs, build - up of d2H and suppression of certain enzyme functions can result."
357,The opposing patterns between the mhu - 2 mission and rr - 5 / rr-7 may arise from diverse factors owing to experimental design differences. The timing of sample collection introduces a critical variable. skin has an anatomically heterogeneous gene expression profile. fibroblasts exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on their positional identity in relation to the major anatomical axis.
358," marked downregulation of various collagen / ecm - associated genes in the dermal layer compared to pre - flight conditions. Certain genes, such as sparc and col3a1, showed an upregulation in one or both compartments of the epidermis. blood data obtained from the same i4 astronauts at 1 -, 45 -, and 82 - days post - flight suggests that most gene alterations observed upon landing revert back to normal levels."
359,"We identified flg as one of the cross - mission genes in the spaceflight vs ground control mice data with downregulation across the majority of data subsets. We observed post - flight vs pre - flight downregulation of flg in the epidermis of i4 astronauts. caspase - 14, an enzyme encoded by the casp14 gene, cleaves filaggrin, breaking it down into free amino acids. These amino acids serve as integral components of natural moisturizing factors, contributing to the preservation of skin hydration and ph 111."
360," s1pr1 was upregulated in most murine skin subsets and in all compartments for the post - flight vs pre - flight i4 astronauts ’ skin samples. in the rr - 5 mission, after a 30 - day recovery, in - flight effects may have been reversed as s1 Pr1 expression was downregulated. downregulation of s1Pr1 has been reported to be necessary for activation of resident memory cells in skin 35."
361," calcitriol, tretinoin, and tamoxifen showed significant positive correlation with regulatory changes. olaparib, estrogen, and diethylstilbestrol showed an opposing pattern. estrogen plays a crucial role in skin health, influencing keratinocyte function, collagen production, moisture retention and telogen - anagen follicle transition."
362,"Molecular alterations observed in the space flown mice and astronaut skin data show similarities with molecular effects associated with drugs like tretinoin and tamoxifen 123. topical moisturizers and emollients, as commonly used by astronauts, may help to counteract the physiological consequences of disrupted barrier function genes. gene analysis revealed some genes of interest and potential mechanisms to investigate in the context of countermeasures."
363,"The i4 skin data we focused on changes in the compartments where the gene is established to be predominantly expressed. lack of individual skin layer data from the rodent datasets means that generated hypotheses relating to mouse physiology cannot be confirmed without follow - up investigations. lastly, gene expression levels differ between skin compartments so an identical fold - change value in a layer where the specific gene expression is generally low may not represent the same magnitude in a layers where the same gene is relatively greater."
364,"The findings can guide future research to develop countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight - associated skin damage. conclusion our findings can help future research on developing countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight. The findings can also help develop new treatments for skin damage caused by spaceflight, the researchers say."
365,"Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces. microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively."

367,"Microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness 1 – 4. altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading - induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue. identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of space flight continues as one of nasa ’ s long - term mission objectives."
368," rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate spaceflight microgravity conditions. Tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise. Myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin - coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses."
369,"Myoblasts were seeded and differentiated into myotubes on an laminin - coated elastic membrane, which was then stretched to observe the cellular responses 34. based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the flexcell® system."
370,C2c12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. We maintained myotubes on laminin - coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a strexcell® system. We observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses.
371," strexcell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. system that could impair compatibility for research in spaceflight, including the necessity of a powerful vacuum pump, considerable weight, and difficulty generating true uniaXial stretch."
372,"Strain program was set at 0. 7 hz frequency, 12 % stretch using a sinusoidal wave pattern for 1 hour / day for 2 or 5 days. exposure to the uniaxial cyclic stretching was utilized to induce hypertrophy with increased loading. cyclic stretch cessation was deemed off - transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy release of cyclic tensile loads."
373,"Myotubes were fixed in a 4 % paraformaldehyde ( pfa ) solution for 30 min at 4 °c. cell membranes were solubilized for intracellular assays using a 0. 5 % triton - x - 100 for 3 min until washed with 1x pbs. myotubes immunofluorescence staining was visualized using a leica sp8 confocal laser scanning microscope ( 20x, zoom 2. 25, emission wavelength 450 – 500 nm )"
374,"Twenty µg of protein samples were loaded on sds - page gels and electrophoresed at 120 v for 75 min using a bio - rad protein iii gel box onto a nitrocellulose membrane. membranes were then blocked in a non-fat milk buffer ( 5 % non- fat milk in tbs ) for 1 h. proteins were visualized using clarity western ecl substrate ( biorad, cat # 1705061 ) enhanced chemiluminescence detection."
375,Calpain activity was performed using a calpain activity assay fluorometric kit ( abcam # ab65308 ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions. The fluorescence signal was detected at 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission using a microplate reader. statistical approach results were collected and processed for statistical analysis using prism 9. 0 ( graphpad)
376,"We used c2c12 mouse lineage myoblasts to generate myotubes, and mounted on laminin. β - sarcoglycan immunofluorescence positive staining was used as a membrane marker to calculate the myotube diameter as a marker of hypertrophy and atrophy. quantification of the total nuclei population per field revealed a significant reduction as a result of 2 and 5 days of cyclic stretching compared to the controls."
377,"Myotubes were divided into the following groups ( n = 4 / group ) : 2 days quiescent control ( no stretch ( 2d), 2 days cyclic stretch (2dhy ), 5 days cycled stretch ( 5dhy), and 2 - days of stretch. Calpain activity is expressed as fluorogenic values ( rfu / mg / min) for talin."
378,Calpain activity that was measured by fluorescence revealed a significant increase in activity in the 2dhy and 5dhy groups. Three days of cessation of daily bouts of cyclic stretch (3dat) resulted in a significantly lower level of talin than 2 and 5 days of dailycyclic stretch. The akt activation pathway has been involved in regulating muscle hypertrophy and atrophy.
379,"Myotubes were divided into the following groups ( n = 4 / group ) : 2 days quiescent control ( no stretch), 2 days cyclic stretch ( 2dhy), 5 days cycled stretch ( 5dhy ), and 2 - days of cyclicStretch followed by a 3 - day cessation of stretch ( 3dat).

381,"We measured myotube levels of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin - 1ß ( il -1ß ) and interleokin - 6 ( il-6 ) as well as the p65 subunit of the pro - inflammatory, pro - oxidant transcription factor nuclear factor kappa - b ( nf - κb) protein abundance. There was a 2 – 3 fold increase in il-1ß, il - 6, and p65 compared with 2dhy, 5dhy and the no stretch controls, similar to the pattern observed in total foxo3a levels. These data suggest a significant role of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and nf-"
382,"We examined the efficacy of the application and withdrawal of uniaxial cyclic stretch on myotubes as a prospective bioreactor for use in spaceflight research. withdrawal fromcyclic stretch elicits an ‘ off - transient ’ period that our data suggest mimics unloading - microgravity. The findings have a number of parallels with the data published by soltow, et al. ( 2013 ) 35 using the flexcell® as a model for overloading and unloading."
383,"Uniaxial stretch and cessation of stretch can be validly used to test myotube responses to both increased and decreased mechanical loading. in contrast, rotating wall vessels bioreactors are commonly used in tissue engineering and cell culture research to simulate microgravity conditions. increased tensile stress and strain in skeletal muscle fibers promote muscle growth by elevating protein synthesis."
384," withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to increased levels of unphosphorylated ( i. e., active ) foxo3a, consistent with protein degradation ’ s role in muscle atrophy. spaceflight lowered the akt activity pathway by downregulating the eif4 / p70s6k signaling."
385,"Akt activation is a well - known causal regulator of protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle. downregulation of the akt activation pathway, which is associated with dephosphorylation of akt and 4e - bp1, has been consistently reported in muscle atrophy. simultaneous activation of foxo3a and suppression of an akt - mtor pathways with skeletal muscle wasting has been a frequent observation."
386,Inflammatory cytokines il - 1ß and il - 6 and the p65 subunit of nf - kappab were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days. The data support the hypothesis that much of inflammatory medication in unloaded muscle fibers could be localized within the muscle fibers. Upregulation of inflammatory mediators during the loading period must be a result of mechanosensing within the myot tubes.
387,"This study has some limitations, while the unloaded / microgravity model was not free floating. skeletal muscles are complex tissues that generate tensile forces to produce body movement and stability. muscles adapt to changes in tensile loading by adjusting their mass and cross - sectional area. anabolism, elevation of catabolic signaling, and thus atrophy of the myotubes."
388,"The strexcell uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study spaceflight and re - ( over ) loading in skeletal muscle cells. Inactivity turns off signaling for muscle hypertrophy, while elevating pro - inflammatory, pro - catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation."
389,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading. This can be partly attributed to ca 2 + dysregulation. Treatment with the antioxidant, manganese ( iii ) meso - tetrakis ( n - n - butoxyethylpyridinium - 2 - yl ) porphyrin, mntnbuoe -2 - pyp 5 + ( buoe ), could attenuate muscle atropha and serca dysfunction."
390,"Soleus muscles were obtained from the nasa biological institutional scientific collection. muscles came from male c57bl / 6 j mice from the rr - 18 mission which had two control groups, ground control ( gc ) and vivarium ( viv ) control, as well as a flight group which had mice housed on the international space station for 35 days. all mice were treated weekly with either buoe ( 1 mg / kg ) or saline via subcutaneous injection beginning one week prior to launch and continuing for the duration of spaceflight. upon live return to earth, muscles were dissected and stored in rnalater at −80 °c. muscles were thawed,"
391,All data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean ( sem ). no statistical differences were detected between the gc and viv groups and so they were combined within their respective treatment groups to increase statistical power. a two - way anova with tukey ’ s post hoc test was used to compare the main effects of gc / viv vs flight and saline vs buoe as well as any interaction that may exist. outliers were detected and removed prior to analysis if they were ±2 standard deviations from the mean of their respective group.
392,"Multiomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species. relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like extibacter muris and dysosmobacter welbionis. host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile Acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. Changes imply that interactions at the host - gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology."
393,"International space exploration coordination group, representing 27 of earth ’ s space agencies, has outlined a clear target for a crewed mission to mars in the global exploration roadmap. These guiding objectives have driven development of the imminent commercial low earth orbit destinations and gateway, and the artemis mission goal of a permanent lunar surface habitat by the early 2030s."
394,"The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to earth. Microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight can lead to shifts in the gut microbiome. Gut microbiota play an essential role in mediating healthy human metabolic function on earth. There has been increasing research into gut microbiome dynamics associated withspaceflight."
395,16 s rrna amplicon sequencing and reference - based whole metagenome sequencing ( wms) identified 14 asvs as different in relative abundance ( p < 0. 1 ) between spaceflight ( iss ) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight. Wms identified significant enrichment of dorea sp. and the species lactobacillus murinus. intestinal and hepatic transcriptomics were then used to assess the associated gene expression response of mice to space flight.

406,Characterisation of microbiota used 16 s rrna amplicon sequencing as well as wms sequencing from faecal samples collected from gc _ lar and flt _ lar. A total of 133 exact sequence variants ( esvs ) were inferred across all samples. parabacteroides goldsteinii had the highest relative abundance throughout the samples and accounted for 53. 7 % of sequence counts.
407,"Wms of faecal dna generated 277, 294, 078 reads after quality control. co - assembly across all 32 mice generated 219, 259 contigs.

412," enrichment of d. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice compared to their respective ground controls is noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts 17, 18, 45. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Other butyrate producers, such as intestinimonas butyriciproducens and acutalibacter muris were depleted in mice during spaceflight."

This agrees with findings from the rr - 5 mission 39, which found significantly increased levels of serum choline in mice after spaceflight, suggesting a broad impact on lipid metabolism."
414,"Metagenome functional prediction identified 4, 583, 759 genes in the co - assembly generated from all 32 mice. A high proportion ( 91. 4 % ) of genes, including differentially abundant genes, remain unannotated. kegg annotated genes included the pathogenicity locus ( including tcdab ) from c. difficile."
415,"Changes in metagenomic gene inventories, and specific bacterial species with well - characterised functions, due to spaceflight suggest gut microbiome changes which should influence lipid and bile acid homoeostasis, and the immune system of the murine host. Changes in fatty acid pathways included fatty acid biosynthesis ( 00061), fatty acid metabolism ( 01212 ), fatty acid degradation ( 00071 ) and butanoate metabolism ( 00650) Bile acid metabolism was reflected in bile secretion ( 04976 ) and cholesterol metabolism (04979) antimicrobial resistance genes were represented in the pathways for beta - lactam resistance ( 01501 ) and biosynthesis of various antibiotics ( 00998"

418," spaceflight led to common upregulation of pathways associated to intestinal extracellular matrix ( ecm ) remodelling, including ecm - receptor interactions, focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction pathways, and cortisol production represented through the cushing syndrome pathway. the bile secretion pathway was significantly upregulated after 29 days of spaceflight, but downregulated after 56 days."
419,"After 29 days of spaceflight, abcc2 was significantly downregulated, suggesting reduced ba export to the colon. Asbt, ibabp, ostα, ostβ and ugt1a1 were all significantly upregulated as well as rxrα ( not fxr ), fgf15 / 19 and fgfr4. These changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine."
420," gene expression analysis of multiple tissues in mice after spaceflight. enrichment within the circadian rhythm pathway of the kidney, liver, eye, adrenal gland and various muscle tissues. major clock genes, the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ( clock ) and brain and muscle arnt - like protein - 1 ( bmal1 ; arntl ) transcription factors were significantly upregulated after 56 days."
421,"These spaceflight - associated changes in core clock genes, such as upregulation of bmal1, arntl and npas2, largely agree with those found in murine muscle tissue after longer - term spaceflight. These clock genes regulate nutrient absorption, gut motility, intestinal barrier function and immunity."
422," tenascins ( tnc ) in mice after 29 days of spaceflight, which became more pronounced after 56 days. this coincided with upregulation of integrin ( itga5 and itga7 ) and matrix glycoprotein ( sdc4 and gp5 ) receptors. extensive changes to mucosa were indicated by widespread downregulation of cell adhesion molecules during spaceflight."
423,"Spaceflight alters gene expression in the liver hepatic gene differential expression analysis comparing mice after 29 days and 56 days in space to their relative ground controls identified 4029 de genes and 4068 de genes, respectively ( fdr < 0. 1 ; fig. 6a, h ; supplementary figs. 15, 16 and data 5 ). of these, 48 % and 49 % were increased due to spaceflight, respectively. This provides an insight into the role the host - gut - microbiome interface might play in the current broad consensus of immune dysregulation in spaceflight environments."
424,"Gsea of liver tissue responses also revealed highly consistent responses at the pathway level to 29 and 56 days of spaceflight. these comprised downregulation of immune response pathways, similar to those seen in the intestine, as well as steroid metabolism, type i diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease and nafld. spaceflight also led to common upregulation of insulin resistance, hippo signalling, inositol phosphate metabolism, cushing syndrome and hepatocellular cancer pathways. certain pathways were different over time. after 29 days, long - term depression and maturity onset diabetes of the young pathways were upregulated. after 56 days, bile secretion and circadian rhythm were downregulated, while glycoly"

426,Hepatic accumulation of cholesterol is characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption 97. Bile acid conjugating acyl - coenzyme a : amino acid n - acyltransferase 1 and 2 ( acnat1 and acnat2 ; baatp1 / 2 ) genes were significantly upregulated. The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation is sulfonation of bile acids.
427," pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days. These included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance. liver glycogen phosphorylase ( pygl ) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight."
428,"Claudins, which were largely downregulated in the intestine where they are commonly expressed within tight junctions, were upregulated in liver tissue after 56 days of spaceflight. Upregulation of gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial - associated molecular patterns and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the pparα pathway. other pathways enriched in the liver after spaceflight included cushing syndrome, hypercortisolism consistent with elevation of cholesterol levels, and hepatocellular cancer."

We applied gsh ( with glu and sorbitol as positive and negative controls, respectively ) to leaf 1 of the gcamp3 plants and visualized the systemic cyt in the whole seedlings. The fast and transient increase of cyt was notably triggered in systemic leaves by gsh."
499,"Gsh - triggered systemic [ ca 2 + ] cyt transmission was dramatically repressed by pretreatment on the petiole of the wounded leaf with the ca2 + channel inhibitor lacl 3.

Taken together, our results shown in figs. 1 – 4 suggest that. gsh serves as a critical wound signal to trigger long - distance. propagation of [ ca 2 + ] cyt waves in a glr. 3 - dependent manner."
506,"The initiation of a rapid defense against biotic attacks and mechanical damages is crucial for plant survival in changing environment. due to lack of a nervous system, plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to deliver the wound signal from the site of injured organs to the distal undamaged tissues. in this study, we find that the gsh - deficient mutant, in spite of the highly accumulated glu, showed impaired plant defense signaling events."
507,"When plants are subjected to insect herbivory or mechanical wounding, they rapidly activate the ja signaling pathway in whole plant tissues. wound - induced systemic defense signaling requires the involvement of glr ion channel proteins. our study found that the gsh - triggered long - distance calcium - mediated defense response was suppressed in gcamp3."
508,"Little is known about how signaling substances are transmitted in plants to activate long - distance signaling. The successful transmission of neural signals from one cell to another in animals relies on the mutual conversion of chemical signals ( neurotransmitters ) and electrical signals.

518,C. albicans - colonized mice developed ethanol - induced cta more rapidly. mice injected with 2g / kg ethanol showed significant aversion to the tastant. There were no differences in colonization or mouse weight throughout the experiment. motor coordination deficits can be restored by ep receptor antagonism. The more rapid development of ethanol-induced cta in c. alBicans - Colonized mice suggests these mice could be more susceptible to the behavioral effects of ethanol.
519," motor coordination defects were tested using performance on the balance beam, which can measure coordination based on the number of slips and falls on the beam. mice were injected with ss or ethanol and their performance was assessed. blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice. These results indicate a synergistic effect of ethanol treatment ( including prior treatment ) and c. albicans - colonization that increased the sedative effects."
520," blocking pge 2 signaling in c. albicans - colonized mice reduced their susceptibility to ethanol - induced impairment of motor control. we did not see a similar reversal of phenotypes by antagonists in either the oft or lorr ( figure s7 ). taken together, the results showed that c.Albicans- colonised mice were more susceptible to the depressant and sedative effects of ethanol."
521,C. albicans - colonization in mice reduces ethanol preference and consumption. injection of uncolonized mice with dm - pge 2 reduced ethanol consumption. low concentrations of dm-pge 2 (25 – 50 ug / kg) reduced consumption moderately. higher doses of pge - m (100 – 300ug / kg ) reduced ethanol preference more strongly.
522,"C. albicans - colonized mice showed altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. expression of one of the receptors, drd2, was significantly decreased. expression in the pfc and nac did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system. saccharin preference may not be reduced because of the lack of an additional insult to the bbb. pge 2 treatment altered reward learning to morphine in mice."
523,"C. albicans - colonized mice showed increased lorr onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test ( oft ), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. Results suggest that pge 2 impact on ep1 and ep2 receptors could contribute to motor control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in the oft and lorr tests could be driven by other systems."
524,"C. albicans colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in c57bl / 6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression and c. alBicans - colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol. If drd2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with c.Albicans - colonization, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress."
525,"Anhydrobiosis is a phenomenon in which organisms survive extreme dehydration by entering a reversible ametabolic state. tardigrades utilize several protective mechanisms against desiccation. The expression of cahs1, cahs3, and cahs8 tended to enhance the resilience to the hyperosmotic conditions."
526,"Anhydrobiosis is a phenomenon where an organism loses almost all of its water and enters a state of reversible ametabolism. It is observed in both microorganisms and animals, including bacteria, nematodes, seeds, spores, gemma, lichen soredium, egg, shoot fragments, and more. heat shock proteins and ros scavenging have been proposed as mechanisms of desiccation tolerance."
527," cahs proteins are constitutively expressed in ramazzottius varieornatus, which exhibits strong desiccation tolerance without de novo gene expression. In another tardigrade, hypsibius exemplaris, the expression of cah proteins is strongly induced under desiccated condition. It remains unclear whether the heterologous expression of Cahs proteins confers hyperosmotic stress tolerance to cultured mammalian cells."
528," plasmids were constructed by standard molecular biology methods. the cdnas of r. varieornatus were synthesized with codon optimization for the human genome using gblocks gene fragments. Since cahs proteins are known to be abundantly expressed in tardigrades, we optimized the codon of the cahs genes in order to express sufficient amounts of cah proteins in hela cells."
529,"Hela cells were seeded on a 35 - mm dish ( # 150460, thermo fisher scientific, rockford, il, usa ) or a 6 well plate. Plasmid expressing the cahs1 - megfp protein, the cah3 - megFP, theCah8 - meg FP, the Cah12 - meg FPS and the Cahs12 - MegFP were transfected into the hela cells with 293fectin tm transfection reagent. cells were maintained in the presence of puromycin for more than one week to select bulk cell lines in fig. 2."
530,"After 48 h of transfection, the culture medium was replaced with an imaging medium containing fluorobrite tm dmem ( # a1896701, thermo fisher scientific ) supplemented with 1 % glutamax tm supplement and 0. 1 % bovine serum albumin. The imaging medium continuously flowed at 5 psi ( “ psi ” is a unit of pressure ) while heating at 37°c."

The cells were imaged with an inverted microscope ( ix81, olympus / evident ) equipped with a cooled ccd camera."
532,"A 475 / 28 excitation filter, a 20 / 80 beamsplitter dichroic mirror, and a 542 / 27 emission filter were used. live cells were incubated in a stage incubator containing 5 % co 2 at 37°c. the microscope was controlled by metamorph software ( molecular devices ). the fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified in fiji / imagej ( schindelin et al., 2012 ). the background was subtracted by the rolling ball method."

The cells were treated with doxycycline for 24h, followed by the treatment with sorbitol solution for 24H. Half of the cell supernatant was used for the water - soluble tetrazolium ( wst ) - 1 assay with a premix wst - 1 cell proliferation assay system ( # mk400, takara, otsu, japan ) and the other half for the lactate dehydrogen"
534,"High and low values were obtained from the value of the well in the absence of sorbitol and the minimum values on the same day, respectively. The absolute number of cells seeded on the well plate varied between experiments. The “ high ” and “ low ” values were changeable because the ldh assay requires the supernatant to be taken from each well."

These results not only provide new insights into the mechanism of desiccation tolerance in r. varIEornatus, but also suggest a potential use of these cah proteins as cryoprotectants."
537,Bone loss during spaceflight in low earth orbit is primarily associated with site - specific microgravity unloading of weight - bearing sites in the skeleton. spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. This suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossifying during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks.
538,Research into the effects of spaceflight on bone has proven to be complex because of highly variable conditions. The nasa rodent research validation mission ( rr - 1) introduced the nasa rh as an iss national lab facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies. The experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation.
539,A specific focus of our study is the femur because of its major weight - bearing role in the mouse. cancellous regions in the proximal and distal femur provide structural scaffolding during cortical bone growth. spaceflight induces unrecoverable resorption of trabeculae in rodents and humans and increases fracture risk in long bones.
540,ypothesize bone loss in the rodent model is a site - specific phenomenon associated with mechanical unloading of weight - bearing sites in the skeleton. We conducted global and same - animal paired comparisons of bone parameters in the femur and l2 vertebrae sites to rigorously test the idea that bone loss is specific to mechanically unloaded skeletal sites.
541,"12 week old female c57bl / 6j mice were matched by weight and assigned to groups ( n = 10 / group ) housed in standard vivarium cages, and acclimated for 4 weeks to control experimental conditions. food and water were available ad libitum and further husbandry details have been published. secondary dissection tissues used in this study were collected by astronauts on orbit and dissected by the rr - 1 biospecimen sharing program ( bsp ) team on the ground."
542," radiation dosimetry on iss over the duration of the experiment was measured to be about 7. 4 mgy. mice from the transporter or the rh to the microgravity science glovebox for injections and on orbit euthanasia when mice were 21 weeks of age. upon thawing and dissection, femurs and a section of the lumbar vertebral column were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde. cartilage was stained using 0. 1 % safranin - o. bone tissue was visualized using polarized light and differential interference contrast ( dic )."
543,"The right femur from each sample was scanned using bruker skyscan 1272 μct ( kontich, belgium ). scans were performed at 60 kv of x - ray energy with a 0. 25 mm thick aluminum filter. images were taken every 0. 5 degrees and averaged over 3 frames. reconstruction and segmentation reconstructed images of the femur were uploaded to dataviewer software."
544,"The femoral midshaft was analyzed with a cortical voi of 0. 48 mm, determined by averaging the z - position of the proximal and distal ends of the femur. secondary endochondral ossification was visually evaluated in cross - sectional views to determine if the epiphyseal growth plate and mineralized distal cartilage had been converted to the fully ossified cancellous tissue morphology characteristic of seo."
545,"A paired t - test was performed between the vertebrae, femoral head, and distal epiphysis within the same sample. The study evaluated within - subject variation of bone volume at weight - bearing versus non-weight - bearing site pairs. The changes of bv / tv in viv and fl groups relative to gc was calculated."
546,"Bv / tv was significantly decreased in spaceflight compared to all control environments ( bl, −25 % ; viv, −18 % ; gc, −27 % ) ( fig 2a ). fl bones also had significantly fewer trabeculae than basal mice ( −15 % ), which was unchanged in the two control habitats. Overall, the femoral head shows significant bone atrophy expressed in multiple bone parameters after 37 days in space."
547,"Viv bones experience another similar increase in magnitude of tb. pf, which was not statistically significant. The loss of bone in the femoral distal epiphysis is affected by housing type and weightlessness conditions in microgravity. collectively, the data suggest, the vivarium cage housing allows aging - related bone loss to progress in the cancellous regions of weight bearing bones."
548,"Cancellous bone measurements in the distal epiphysis exhibit a housing - related dependency on ( a ) bv / tv as well as an effect from spaceflight. We found that ba / ta is significantly lower in fl compared to viv, although not by a large magnitude ( −6 %, p < 0. 05 ) ( fig 4a ). ct. th is not significantly changed between groups, though a trend exists such that the viv group has thicker cortical bone."
549,"Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral neck indicate fl has less ( a ) ba / ta than viv. nonsignificant trends in the data show an increase in ( b ) ct. th in viv that is opposite in fl. ( c ) e. pm is significantly increased in. viv, gc, and fl from bl, though ( d ) p. pm experiences no changes."
550,"Cortical bone characterization metrics in the femoral midshaft indicate the effect of age increasing ( a ) ba / ta and ( b ) ct. th, which is undone in fl. load - bearing vertebrae do not show μct parameter changes related to age, housing, or spaceflight in microgravity."
551,"The vertebrae experienced an increase in bv / tv by 8 % ± 8 % ( p < 0. 05 ), where the femoral head and distal epiphysis demonstrate significant bone loss of 12 % ± 6 % and 41 % ± 14 %. within samples, these effects were confirmed as all samples experienced similar degrees of loss. thus, the non - weight - bearing spine bone site did not experience significant change in spaceflight while weight- bearing femoral regions underwent extensive bone loss."
552,"The vivarium cage housing, known to provide reduced topological enrichment, also elicited bone losses of smaller magnitude than spaceflight, but only in weight - bearing bone sites. secondary endochondral ossification is accelerated during spaceflight in microgravity. fl bones had 50 % of their cohort ossified in the ( a ) femoral head, over twice as many as in gc cohort."
553,"Safranin - o staining of the femoral head revealed that the region consisted entirely of hypertrophic cartilage region and a well - defined growth plate. within the viv group, sgag content was depleted in the articular cartilage due to early signs of ossification, although the growth plate remained active. The gc sample, classified as seo, has slightly less s gag content than viv, especially in the trabecular region at the top of the image. this plate is marked by light pink staining, which is preserved between two continuous areas of bone."
554,"Proteoglycan content decreases and is upregulated during ossification ( gc, fl ) to finalize remodeling into the dual - walled gap characteristic of distal epiphysis secondary ossified. Proteoglycan can content in ( b ) viv, a loss of the distinct tidemark in ( c ) gC, and a complete deficit in an ossifying sample from ( d ) fl."
555," spaceflight in leo is well - documented to cause significant bone loss and is often compared to physiologically aged, osteopenic phenotypes. early systematic studies of spaceflight effects on rodent bone physiology were conducted in short duration space shuttle space transportation system. more recent results, with longer durations greater than thirty days on the international space station ( iss ) use the rodent habitat hardware ( rh ), on the express rack."
556,"Ground - based spaceflight simulations often use low let radiation, such as x - rays, at high acute doses of a few gray ( gy ) in contrast, spaceflight radiation is high linear energy transfer ( let ), which has been shown to induce bone loss when acute doses are administered. on the iss, the total high let radiation dose over 37 days was only ~ 7. 4 mgy, with an average daily dose of 207 µgy [ 11 ]. this acute dosage in ground simulations is equivalent to ~ 13 years of radiation exposure. through aging, rodents experience decreased bone volume fraction and trabecular number due to remodeling of the bone favoring periosteal cortical development. in contrast"
557,The femoral head is also a key site of skeletal development and maturation. The femoral midshaft experiences high bending torsional loads during normal ambulation. The rh wire mesh interior is associated with increased mouse physical activity that occurs during long - duration spaceflight after initial acclimation.
558,"On earth, the mechanical loading environment within the rodent spinal column is complex, including time - and position - varying loads of lateral bending, flexion / extension, and axial rotation dependent on the task being performed. The response to spaceflight is less understood and likely varies by habitat topology, housing density, age, and experiment duration."
559,"We found that while the former are subject to loss in space, the latter are not. bones from mice in the rh show healthier parameters in directly loaded regions than those from the vivarium. systemic effects in the vertebrae, if present, should result in weaker cancellous structures and cortical bone."
560,The percentage of seo bones increased with age from bl to viv groups. spaceflight was shown to accelerate complete ossification in the femoral head above the rate observed with aging. increased loading via activity experienced in the gc habitat mouse bones decreased the occurrence of ossifying.
561,"Mechanical unloading due to weightlessness in microgravity, not radiation or other systemic factors, is the primary effector of spaceflight - related bone loss in leo. radiation outside of leo will have significant bone effects. additionally, the observation of accelerated epiphyseal closure in the femoral head primary weight - bearing location in mice, suggests mechanical unloading may accelerate seo of juvenile growing long bones into a prematurely mature state."
562,"Free - living nematode caenorhabditis elegans has been routinely used to study gene functions, genetic interactions, and conserved signaling pathways. bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol."
563,"Nematodes of the genus caenorhabditis are an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage. embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite ( bleach ) solution."
564,"Microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage. The major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them. mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to such devices."
565,"We used filters from pluriselect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an op50 - seeded plate. based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 and 20. using our technique, we recovered approximately 9, 500 embryos from one 6 cm op50- seeded plate, compared to approximately 5, 000 embryos by bleach synchronization. to further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol ( peg ) in the m9 buffer ( 3 % w / v ) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three - fold. peg has been used previously in m9 buffers"
566,"We have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization. in summary, we have. developed a Protocol to obtainsynchronized embryos. that improves on the traditional Method of Bleach Synchronization. In the future, we will be able to use this protocol to create synchronized embryos."
567,We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of staged c. elegans embryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate. The technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. All our assays were done on 6 cm plates. higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10 cm or larger plates.
568,"Human position sense appears to deteriorate. under conditions of weightlessness. this was tested, employing three methods of measurement. in hypergravity ( 1. 8g), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly. for repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. it is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint."
569,"Human position sense is one of the proprioceptive senses, ‘the senses within ’ proprioception includes the senses of position, movement, force, heaviness, and balance. Under conditions of weightlessness, position sense can be disturbed. This led us to speculate about possible mechanisms responsible for the disturbance. Here we were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of position sense."
570,"Gravity - dependent vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibration responses. adding gravity - like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants ’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity."
571,"The aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured with each method. the three methods were used to measure gravity during a series of parabolic flights. The results were published in the Journal of Physics and Astronomy."
572,"12 adult participants ( 1female, 11male ) 26 – 53 years old ( m = 37. 9 years, ± 8. 2 sd ), took part in the present study. participation was voluntary. none of the participants performed regular fitness exercises with their arms or reported current or past arm injuries. participants were informed in advance about the experimental tasks and procedures."
573,"The data acquired on the ground ( preflight session ) were analysed. since errors in the different experiments were normally distributed ( shapiro - wilk test ; w = 0. 89 ), a rmanova could be performed, comparing the averaged position errors in three experiments. a significant overall main effect was found. post - comparisons indicated that errors were largest for pointing ( m = 5. 95°) and repositioning."
574,"Matching, pointing and repositioning errors during the different gravity episodes for 12 participants are shown in fig. 4. The trend of an increase in errors during hypergravity and a decrease during microgravity, relative to the normal gravity value is clearly apparent. errors were not normally distributed ( shapiro - wilk test ; w = 0. 75 ; p =. 00191 ), making it necessary to process the data with non- parametric statistics."
575," errors in pointing were significantly larger compared to repositioning ( m = 0. 01° ; sd = 3. 94°, p =. 00669, 2tt ) and matching. errors in the two hypergravity episodes hg1 and hg2 were compared. for all three experiments, no significant difference was found in wilcoxon tests. for hg, error values were significantly higher than those for normal gravity."
576," error values to be lower in mg ( m = 7. 28° ; sd = 5. 63° ) compared to the ng values. for the repositioning task, the required level of significance was not reached ( p =. 0583, 1tt ). again, error values for hg were significantly higher. during hypergravity position errors increased significantly compared with 1g values, while in microgravity they fell significantly. for pointing, errors during hyper gravity increased significantly, but the fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach significance."
577,"During hypergravity position errors increased significantly compared with 1g values, while in microgravity they fell significantly. for pointing, errors during hypergravity increased significantly, but the fall in errors during microgravity failed to reach significance. errors during repositioning showed no significant changes during either increases or decreases in gravity. in addition, the control values in normal gravity for reppositioning were significantly smaller than for pointing ( p <. 003, 2tt )."
578,"For position sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in gravity had significant effects on the measured values. for repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values were unresponsive to changes. in roach et al. ( 2023 ), elbow muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors. since muscle spindles are the only known sensory receptors to exhibit thixotropy ( proske et. 1993 ), such patterns were interpreted as evidence for spindle involvement."
579,"There is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development ( held and bauer 1967 ). if, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms. All of the errors for matching and pointing were in the direction of elbow extension."
580,"In parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. adding gravity - like torque, by means of elastic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the movement, recovered participants ’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. stretching elastic straps across the joint would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor component of the position signal. that, in turn, would recover position sense values in micro gravity to normal levels."
581,"In the present study, for pointing, the error values were significantly larger than for matching ( fig. 4 ). not only were values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at 1g were larger as well. A similar trend in the distribution of pointing errors was observed by roach et al. ( 2023 ). it suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension. We suggest that such an offset was present in the parabolic measurements."
582,"The data of roach et al. ( 2023 ) suggested that in repositioning ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role. It raised the possibility that in generating the position signal the necessary information was likely derived from central sources. We conclude that of the three methods, repositioned was the most accurate and position sense values remained unresponsive to changes in gravity."
583,"Three different methods of measuring position sense are all likely to have different underlying mechanisms. It could be argued that there are several distinct position senses. gravity appears to exert an influence on position sense only when there is evidence of a direct contribution from spindles, as seen in matching and pointing."
584,"Gravity exerts its influence on position sense through changes in torque levels at a joint, leading to an alteration of the joint receptor component of the position signal. if so, why is this not expressed in position sense measured by repositioning? assuming the existence of a body schema as the central repository of spatial information, how is the communication carried out between the body periphery and central sites? are spindles involved in this process? given that the three methods studied here measure essentially the same thing, why are there such substantial differences in the underlying mechanisms?"
585," blood flow restriction training ( bfrt ) is a tool utilized in rehabilitation and injury prevention to improve muscle strength and size. It facilitates gains in muscular strength and hypertrophy at lower loads, allowing for accelerated recovery and less disuse atrophy. It must be applied appropriately and with caution, particularly in individuals with cardiovascular concerns."
586,Three-dimensional poly ( ε - caprolactone ) ( pcl ) scaffolds were combined with adult human mesenchymal stem cells ( hmsc) to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro. aggregate moduli of 21 - day constructs approached normal articular cartilage for tightly woven pcl cultured in bioreactors. chondrogenesis was verified histologically by rounded cells within a hyaline - like matrix that immunostained for collagen type ii.
587,"The study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at e8. calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions."
588," lycopene or fish oil supplements would down - regulate insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( igf - 1 ) and cyclooxygenase 2 ( cox - 2 ) gene expression, respectively, reflecting putative proliferation and inflammatory pathways relevant to carcinogenesis. We conducted a 3 - month randomized, double - blinded, clinical trial comparing prostate tissue gene expression profiles among men with favorable - risk prostate cancer. There was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in igF - 1 expression level between the placebo and Lycopene arms."
589,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in us men with 192,000 new cases and 27,000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2009. 90 % of prostate cancer cases are diagnosed when they are of local / regional stage. active surveillance ( as ) ( also called “ delayed treatment ” ) is becoming recognized as an alternative for many patients with early stage low - grade disease ( “ low burden ” disease)"
590,Fish is rich in long - chain omega - 3 fatty acids that may have anti - inflammatory protective effects against prostate cancer. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test the hypothesis that lycopene and fish oil supplements would beneficially affect gene expression in putative cancer - related pathways.
591,"Men with favorable - risk prostate cancer received either 30 mg / day lycopene, 3 g / day fish oil ( including 1, 098 mg eicosapentaenoic and 549 mg docosahexaenoic fatty acid s ) or placebo. The placebo for lycopen was isocaloric and contained soy oil but no lycopenes. Men were also given a standard daily multivitamin and instructed to refrain from any other vitamin or nutritional supplements."
592,"Study participants, eligibility criteria, and enrollment this study was conducted among men with low - burden prostate cancer, choosing as for disease management. Men met the following criteria : histologically documented prostate adenocarcinoma, extended pattern biopsy within 2 years of enrollment with a gleason sum six or lower with no pattern four or five."
593,Prostate cancer patients with a psa doubling time < 3 months were eligible for the study. Men who were on a nutritional supplement or anti - inflammatory drug were assessed by their doctors regarding whether abstaining from the supplement or drug was deemed medically safe and if so they were asked to undergo a 4 - week washout period. Men were withdrawn from the study when such usage was discovered.
594,"Men were followed according to a standard as protocol, including medical history, physical exam, digital rectal exam, and psa test at three, six, nine, twelve, and 24 months. All biopsies were reviewed by the study pathologist to determine grade / extent of disease and verify that patients still met the criteria."
595,"The study was designed to test for a 2 - fold decrease in expression of igf - 1 and cox - 2 following the 3 - month intervention compared with placebo. patients were randomized with equal probability to one of the three study arms : lycopene, fish oil, or control."
596,The study was designed to test for a 2 - fold decrease in expression of igf - 1 and cox - 2 following the 3 - month intervention compared with placebo. The power of each test was 0. 81 with a directional level of significance of 0. 025 to adjust for the two comparisons. The total planned accrual of 97 patients allowed for a 10 % loss by the 3 month biopsy.
597,"Newman - keuls post hoc test was used to identify which subsets were significantly different. mean baseline and change from baseline results were presented on the log 2 scale. or their interaction. if statistical significance was observed, the newman-keuls test was also used."
598,"Results among 69 men ( 22 assigned to lycopene, 21 to fish, and 26 to placebo ), there was no difference in the change from baseline to the 3 months in igf - 1 expression level. Three unexpected adverse events were observed during the intervention and classified as “ possibly related ” to study treatment. mean age and body mass index at randomization was 61 years (standard deviation 7. 8 years ) and 26. 8 kg / m 2 ( standard deviation 4. 6 kg /m 2 ), respectively."

601,There was virtually no change in cox - 2 expression for the placebo and fish oil supplement groups comparing the 3 month versus baseline levels ( p = 0. 99 ) ( table 3 ). Only 27 % of the lycopene arm achieved a 2 - fold decrease in igf - 1 compared with 23% of the placebo group.
602,"There was no difference in the change in igf - 1 levels with lycopene supplement compared with the placebo ( anova p = 0. 72 ) but a significantly greater change on average was observed among those with an initial high tomato intake compared with a low intake ( 132. 6 vs. 67. 7 ( anti - log ), respectively ( fig. 2 a ). even though a greater mean increase was observed for those with high tomato. intake initially, there was no statistical difference between the low - and high - intake subsets in mean igf. 1 levels for each study arm. No differences between study arms or high / low tomato strata were observed for igF - 1r"
603,"Fig. 2 a mean change from baseline in igf - 1 by baseline tomato intake and randomization arm. probability values are determined for the post hoc newman - keuls test. There was no difference in the change in psa level after the intervention, comparing the lycopene or fish oil arms versus the placebo group."
604," lycopene, tomato intake, and fish oil have been inversely associated with the risk of incident prostate cancer in most but not all observational epidemiologic studies. These results indicated no decrease in the gene expression of igf - i or igf-1r with 3 - month Lycopene supplement compared with placebo. There was no evidence of a decrease in cox - 2 gene expression for fish oil supplement versus placebo."
605,"Omega - 3 fatty acids may have inhibitory effects on prostate cancer cell growth or xenograft tumor weight. We observed no relationship between lycopene supplementation and igf - 1 expression or fish oil supplement and cox - 2 expression. Possible explanations for this apparent discrepancy with other studies include differences in study design, population, specific doses and formulations used for the interventions."
606,3 - month intervention with lycopene or fish oil supplement had no effect on normal prostate expression of igf - 1 and cox - 2 ( respectively) among men on as for low - burden prostate cancer. Further analysis of global gene expression profiles assessed using genome - wide microarrays may shed further light.
607,3 - month intervention with lycopene or fish oil did not significantly change igf - 1 and cox - 2 gene expression in the normal prostate microenvironment. further analysis of global gene expression profiles may shed light on the bioactivity and relevance of these nutrients in prostate cancer.
608,"Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium possesses a stimulon of genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions of low fluid shear force that increase bacterial virulence and alter other phenotypes. A previously uncharacterized member of this stimulon, ydci or stm1625, encodes a highly conserved dna binding protein."
609,"The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance ( mscl ) from e. coli serves as an emergency release valve allowing the cell to survive acute osmotic downshock. Two independent studies now agree that the full - length s. aureus mscl is actually a pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play a role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein, a cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated."
610,E. coli strains including avian pathogenic e. coli pose a considerable threat to both human and animal health. apec strain χ7122 has been used for many years as a model strain to study the molecular mechanisms of expec pathogenicity and zoonotic potential. we previously sequenced and characterized the plasmid pchi7122 - 1 and determined its importance in systemic apec infection.
611,c in their phenotypes. ##c is the abbreviation used to refer to a person of the same sex. It is used to indicate that a person is of a certain sex or gender. It can also be used as a symbol for the sex of a person's body.
612,"E. coli are versatile bacteria; with the majority being non - pathogenic and considered as commensals. a subset of these bacteria has acquired specific virulence attributes that confer an ability to survive in different niches and cause a broad spectrum of intestinal and extra - intestinal diseases. major infections associated with expec in humans include urinary tract infections ( uti ), newborn meningitis ( nbm ) and septicemia. in birds, a subgroup of expec, named avian pathogenic e. coli ( apec ), causes a complex of systemic infections, mainly respiratory, often leading to death."
613,"Possession of multiple large plasmids is often a defining feature of expec, especially apec, in which the virulence is partly plasmid - mediated. Although many studies have been dedicated to understanding the pathogenesis of expe, little is known about the mechanisms of their persistence. We determined that both the nature of plasids and their combinations have an effect on the virulent and the genetic diversity of apec."
614,"The e. coli k - 12 region at 45 min was deleted by replacing it with a different region. The new region is called e.coli.122 ( χ289 : hisg - zee) The region was replaced by a new strain of e.Coli, h30,, slt."
615,This study presents for the first time the sequence of three plasmids of apec strain χ7122. It provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic mechanisms that expec may use for their persistence and survival in stressful conditions. The study aimed to determine the effect of different host strain backgrounds on plasmid - associated phenotypes.
616,"Multiple plasmid - encoded mechanisms, including toxin - antitoxin modules and the novel sugar pathway could be important in the fitness and persistence of apec χ7122. large plasmids were involved in bile resistance ( pchi7122 - 1 and pchi 7122 - 2 ) when present in e. coli k - 12 background. Four different factor - driven biofilms were demonstrated."
617,"Exogenous abscisic acid and l - glutamate can also cause atp accumulation around arabidopsis thaliana roots. release of adp from root epidermis would trigger ionotropic receptor - like activity in the plasma membrane, resulting in transient elevation of cytosolic free calcium."
618,Mscs and mscl act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. The discovery of mscs homologues in plant organelles and MScl in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology underlying these proteins.
619,We differentiated mouse bone marrow cells in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony stimulating factor for 14 days during the flight of space shuttle space transportation system ( sts ) - 126. We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on earth. We also found a pattern of transcript levels that would be consistent with a relatively normal differentiation outcome.
620," mechanical forces including gravity affect endothelial cell ( ecs ) function, and have been implicated in vascular disease as well as physiologic changes associated with low gravity environments. The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ecs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. mu led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro - inflammatory cytokines."
621,Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were cultured at 37°c / 5 % co 2 in ebm® - 2 endothelial cell basal medium. medium was changed the day after seeding and every other day thereafter. the huvecs were used up to passage 12. each group contained five biologically independent samples.
622," mechanical loaded ( ml ) group was placed in the rpm for 24 hours and was exposed to a 30 minutes load period of mechanical stress ( hypergravity ) with centrifugal forces of 12 g at the 4, 8 and 23. 5 - hour time points. for the control and mu groups cultured for 48 hours, the serum concentration was increased at 2 % at the 24 hours time point, while growth factor additives were at ¼ normal concentration."
623,G - loading apparatus was used for mechanical hyperloading as already described 56. The mouse model of hind limb suspension was used to simulate mechanical unloading in vivo 57. The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee ( iacuc ) of the veterans affairs medical center san francisco.
624," quantitative real - time - polymerase chain reaction ribonucleic acid ( rna) was isolated using rneasy mini kit ( qiagen, valencia, ca usa ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol. after 14 days of hindlimb suspension procedure, the animals were sacrificed, their thoracic aorta dissected, placed in rna later and stored at – 80°c. to the experimental animals but without hind limbs suspension."
625," cells were washed, resuspended in 200 ul of pbs with 2 % fbs and analyzed using a lsr ii flow cytometer ( bd biosciences ) and flowjo software ( tree star ). After 3 washes in pbs, cells were incubated with secondary antibody alexa fuor 488 anti rabbit igg ( h + l ) during 1 hour at room temperature."
626,"24 hours of mu leads to a significant decrease in the expression of adhesion molecules icam - 1, vcam - 1 and e - selectin as well as inflammatory mediators il - 6 and tnf - α ( figure 1a ). this response remained similar after 48 hours of exposure to mu. mechanical loading reverses the changes mediated by mechanical unloading in endothelial cells."
627," mu significantly affected the morphology of huvecs. there was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with mu. There appeared to be disorganization of the f - actin network with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus. addition of l - name during the mu exposure had no effect on caveolin - 1 distribution, which remains perinuclear, however ml seemed to change towards 1 g conditions."
628, simulation of mu by hindlimb suspension led to a significant increase in enos and caveolin - 1 and - 2 expression in mouse aortas. il - 6 also significantly decreased. There was a significant decrease in e - selectin expression. expression of other inflammatory or adhesion molecules did not decrease significantly.
629,"Microgravity alters the cytoskeleton of ecs. it appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells. Our findings suggest that ecs gene expression and cytoarchitecture are tightly linked to gravitational mechanical forces."
630,2 hours of simulated microgravity in eahy926 ecs lead to actin rearrangements and increase in nitric oxide production. Huvecs in microgravity for 96 hours had disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a decrease in the total amount of actin 30.
631,Microgravity had opposite effects on icam - 1 compared to vcam - 1 and e - selectin. mechanical unloading led to an increase in caveolin - 1. and - 2 gene expression. this correlated with an. increase in enos expression and nitrite concentration.
632,Study has important implications for spaceflight. Astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance ( oi ) upon returning to a gravity environment. Changes seen would be considered “ anti - inflammatory ” and possibly protective for early atherogenesis. This opens the way to explore new therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases by manipulation of cell phenotype using gravitational forces.
633,"Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast - mediated bone resorption. We hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. We exposed 16 - week-old female c57bl / 6j mice to microgravity for 15 - days on the sts - 131 space shuttle mission."
634,"Pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton is an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity. This study offers new evidence for microgravity - induced osteocytic osteolysis, and cdkn1a / p21 - mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest. finally the apoptosis inducer trp53 was down - regulated by −1. 54 fold ( p < 0. 01 ), possibly associated with the quiescent survival - promoting function of cdkn 1a /p21. to these cells."
635,"At 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. During spaceflight, gravity - generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue Regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects."
636,"Microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts. In skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms. Analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short - term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long - term degenerative effects of microgravity."
637,"Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the mineralized matrix, in the bone remodeling process. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli. We also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocyte in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces."
638,"Osteocytic osteolysis is a form of osteoporosis. It is a type of bone cancer. It can be treated with bone grafts or grafts from other parts of the body. For more information, visit osteocyticostigraphy.org."

The proximal Femur was used for trap staining and immunohistochemical analysis of proteins of interest as described below. Images were acquired at 50 kv and 800 µa with 0. 5 mm aluminum x - ray detector filter, a pixel resolution of 6. 77 µm."
641,"A selected region of 4. 89 mm ( 720 slices ), starting from 5 slices proximal to caudal apex of the obturator foramen through ischial tuberosity ( fig. 1a ), was analyzed using ctan software. as the mouse ischium is a thin bone with similarly sized bridge - like trabeculae connecting two opposing cortical sheets, we were unable to analyse cortical and trabECular bone regions separately. instead we contoured along a perimeter of the cortical bone using a “ shrink - wrap ” custom plug - in of ctan."
642,Hard x - ray transmission microscopy ( txm ) facility at the stanford synchrotron radiation light source ( ssrl ). analysis was performed on similarly oriented transverse sections of cortical bone from mouse ischia near the dorsal - most point of the descending ischial ramus. We used chlorapatite crystals standards and methods previously described.
643,"The right proximal femur was used for tartrate resistance acid phosphatase staining. bone marrow was gently aspirated from the shaft region of the femur so as not to disturb cancellous bone and bone marrow in the femoral head. flushed bone was then demineralized using 20 % edta for 21 days, with solution changes every three days. decalcified bones were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin in preparation for immunohistochemical analysis."
644,"Total rna was isolated from both rnalater - fixed pelvic ilia ( flushed of bone marrow ) from spaceflight and ground control animals. gene expression was analyzed using qiagen pathway - focused mouse qpcr arrays. We examined genes involved in osteogenesis, extracellular matrix, ubiquitination, and the p53, pi3k, nfκb, and map kinase, signaling pathways in bone tissue."

647,"All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post - landing. The posture of space - flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10 % less food, and 24 % less water than synchronous ground controls. spaceflight causes osteoclast and osteocyte - mediated bone loss."
648,Ischial shape localized to surface of descending ramus of ischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen. flight samples exhibited a more open cross - sectional geometry compared to the ground control. flight animals exhibited a higher percentage of slices in the 0. 007 – 0. 128 mm range. ground control samples also exhibited greater thickness ( orange / red ) then the flight samples.
649,"Ground control samples ( f) exhibited greater thickness ( orange / red ) then the flight samples ( g ), indicating a reduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples. in order to study nanoscale aspects of bone loss following spaceflight, we used transmission x - ray microscopy to perform 40 nm resolution nano - computed tomography ( nanoct ) no difference was found in bulk density of cortical."
650,"Flight samples exhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17 % in cross sectional area. lacunar circularity decreased in spaceflight by 9 %. bulk density analysis showed no statistical difference between flight and ground control animals. to characterize osteoclast bone resorbing activity during spaceflight, we used trap staining on sections of the proximal femur."
651,"We found a 197 % increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head growth plate of flight samples. pyknotic nuclei were occasionally present in tissue surrounding bone, but were non - detectable in osteocytes. these results indicate roles for both osteoclastic and osteocytic bone degradation in microgravity."
652,Osteoclasts. analysis of osteoclastic activity in the trabecular region below the femoral head of the femur. showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight samples compared to ground controls. spaceflight induces mmp - mediated extracellular matrix remodeling in bone.
653,"Spaceflight promotes bone extracellular matrix degradation. Overall increase in expression of collagen, tuft1, sparc, and phex may be related to increased bone mineralization following degradation. immunohistochemical analysis localized over - expression of mmp10 to osteocytes in the shaft of the proximal femur in flight samples."

657,"We found that spaceflight suppresses pro - osteogenic growth and proliferation gene expression in bone to further study the effects of spaceflight in reducing bone formation. We found several genes associated with cell growth and differentiation that were altered, including egr1, myod1, and fgf3 which were down - regulated."
658,"Spaceflight alters mrna expression of genes associated with osteogenic growth and mitogenic signal transduction pathways. expression levels of tumor suppressor gene p53 ( trp / p53 ) were down - regulated 1. 54 fold. expression of mDM2, a negative regulator of p53, was also increased, indicating suppression of the p53 apoptotic pathway. cell cycle arrest related genes fbxo4, fbXo31, btg2, and cdkn2b were also altered in flight samples."
659,"Spaceflight causes overexpression of the cell cycle arrest molecule, p21, independently of p53 activation. We found that osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur were localized to p21. We also observed p21 - positive nuclei in cross - sections and longitudinal sections of muscle fibers adjacent to the femur."
660,"Using a rabbit anti - mouse p21 polyclonal antibody, we found that osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur were p21 - positive in flight samples but not in synchronous ground controls. muscle fibers surrounding the femur contained strongly positive p21 staining nuclei in spaceflight but not ground control samples. No significant staining was found in most sections from both flight and ground controls ’, indicating that p53 was not strongly expressed."
661," alterations in pi3k subunits were noted except a small change in the alpha polypeptide of the catalytic subunit of Pi3k. downstream effectors of these signaling pathways were also altered in response to spaceflight. Analysis of nfκb transcriptional target genes involved in cell adhesion, regulation of apoptosis and growth factors and ligands including traf1, bmp4, egr1, p53, and mmp3 were found to be down - regulated."
662,"Microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast - mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space."
663,"Microgravity induces high levels of osteoclast - mediated bone resorption in our model system. We then sought to determine if osteocytic osteolysis was also activated. osteocytes, are the most abundant cell type in bone and are thought to play a role in spaceflight - induced bone loss. we found no bone density differences between flight and ground samples. flight samples did exhibit lacunar enlargement relative to ground controls, and decreased circularity, and increased canalicular diameter."
664,"The number of trap - positive osteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground controls, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar emptying. It is currently debated whether osteocytes contribute to bone remodeling and loss during spaceflight. However, our results support a role for microgravity - induced osteocytic osteolysis."
665,"Mmp10 positive in flight samples but not in ground controls, indicating that the up - regulation of mmp10 transcripts may originate in osteocytes. We also hypothesized that bone loss in space may be mediated by intracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of p53 and p21 during osteogenesis."
666,Previous research has found that hindlimb unloading can result in osteocyte apoptosis and bone loss in the lumbar region of the spine. In contrast to these findings we determined that mrna expression levels of p53 in marrow free bone tissue was down - regulated. immunohistochemical analysis showed that p21 in flight samples was strongly localized to osteoblast nuclei on the periosteal surface.
667,"Elevated cdkn1a / p21 levels in spaceflight may explain the observed reduction in osteogenesis and bone growth. in addition to bone, our gene expression results also show accumulation of p21 in muscle ( fig. 6 ) and heart tissue ( a. kumar, e. c. almeida, and r. k globus, unpublished results ). elevated levels of ros can result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants."

669,"Myod1, twist1, and egr1 were altered in spaceflight. decreased myod1 expression suggests a decrease in p21 levels associated with cell differentiation. decreased levels of eGr1 leads to decreased formation of the egr 1 / sp1 complex. vitamin d receptor and sox9, two transcription factors involved in osteogenesis, were also differentially expressed in space flight."
670," vdr gene expression is stimulated by ras / raf / map kinase signaling through the ap - 1 site on the vdr promoter. vitamin d has been shown to modulate nfκb activity in multiple cell types, which suggests a role for the vitamin d receptor in regulation of the nfkkb pathway. vdr - null mice have been showed to have decreased iκbα levels due to loss of vdr- p65 interaction affecting nfkb transcriptional activity. rps6kb1, a down - stream effector of the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway, was also down - regulated in spaceflight."

676,"Chronic skeletal unloading diminishes hindlimb bone blood flow. during reloading, femoral perfusion was lower in the distal metaphyseal region of 7 - d hu rats. vascular resistance was also higher in all regions of the femur in 14 - dhu rats during loading. decreases in shear stress and circumferential stress occurred in the pna with hu that later returned to control levels."
677,"Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune - related conditions. microorganisms can become more virulent in space causing further challenges to health. We found that hypergravity improves resistance to toll - mediated fungal infections except in a known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene."
678," immune dysfunction is a major health - related problem on earth. without normal immune function, many threats to long - term survival in space exist. We have brought advances in understanding the host defense of drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight."
679,"Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in drosophila. The toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and gram - positive ( lys - type peptidoglycan ( pgn ) ) infections, and the imd pathway responds to gram - negative ( dap - type pgn) infections. The mechanisms of interactions within and between the toll and imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood."
680,Redox homeostasis is critical in regulating the fate and function of multipotent cells in the central nervous system.

683,"Following exposure to microgravity, there is a reduced ability of astronauts to augment peripheral vascular resistance, often resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The results indicate that the impaired vasoconstriction following spaceflight occurs through the ryanodine receptor - mediated intracellular ca 2 + release mechanism. such vascular changes in astronauts could compromise the maintenance of arterial pressure during orthostatics."
684,"Tissue for morphologic study is fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde, while tissues for molecular study are fixed in rna later. The majority of the tissues remained intact, including general morphology and finer details such as root hairs and trichomes. These technologies have wide application to any situation where recovery of biological resources is limited."
685,"Seven c57bl / 6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the sts - 131 mission. upon mission completion, all 15 mice calvariae were imaged on a micro - computed tomography scanner. microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in bv of the space flight ( sf ) group compared to the ground control ( gc ) group."
686,"Alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein muca. muca is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees algu from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis.

Microarray analysis revealed altered levels of 363 transcripts belonging to several global regulons."
688," leptin - deficient ob / ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. femur length, bone mineral content ( bmc ) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob / Ob mice than in wt mice. cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower. reduced bone res orption resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obesity ob /Ob mice."
689,"Natural variation in organic cation transporter 1 affects root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine. cape verde islands ( cvi ) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas landsberg erecta ( l er ) was the most sensitive. oct1 expression was higher in cvi than in l er, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive than wild - type plants."
690," polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants. their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules."
691,"Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. It increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans and root weight in rice."
692,"Cadaverine has profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions. The underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverin alters plant growth and development are still unknown. Natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadavine was examined. Organic cation transporter 1 ( oct1, at1g73220 ) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) involved in this response."
693,"Seedlings of eight arabidopsis accessions were grown on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μm cadaverine. A decrease in root length between control and increasing cadaversine treatments was observed for all accessions tested. alterations in root waving and skewing and an increase in adventitious and lateral root emergence were also noticed in most accessions. In terms of root length, cvi - 1 and knox - 18 were some of the most resistant accessions to cadavine, whereas l er - 2 was one of the more sensitive."
694,L er roots were only 35 % as long on this concentration of cadaverine as on control medium. This suggests that the reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell elongation and division. A qtl on chromosome 1 affects root length responses to cadavine due to the large difference between cvi and l er in root growth responses.
695,"A strong qtl for relative root growth response to cadaverine was identified at the end of chromosome 1 in two independent trials. The l er to cvi breakpoints in these lines were fine - mapped, and the candidate region was narrowed to a 5. 3mb interval. no epistasis was observed between this qtl and other parts of the genome."
696,"Plants were grown at a 30 ° backward tilt for 6 d. root lengths on media containing 0, 100, and 500 μm cadaverine are shown. Asterisk indicates the first concentration on which the root length was significantly different from the length on control medium. error bars indicate ±se, and n = 18 – 34."

698," oct1 from cvi and l er genomic dna was sequenced. no large insertions or deletions were found, and only one amino acid change was found : residue 431 in the second exon is serine in cvi, alanine in l er. cadaverine treatment did not significantly change oct1 expression in either accession."
699," oct1 - 1 mutant was previously found to carry a single t - dna insertion near the 3 ’ end of the gene. This mutant was also reported to not express any oct1 rna, as determined by rt – pcr using primers aligning on each side of the intron ( lelandais - briere et al., 2007 ). To evaluate a role for oct1 in root length responses to cadaverine, we used a mutant that produces a truncated oct1 transcript."
700," oct1 - 1 produces a truncated oct1 transcript that is highly unlikely to encode a functional protein. rescue line 1 had significantly higher oct1 expression compared with the ws wild type, whereas rescue line 2 had a similar level ofOct1 expression. root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment."
701,"Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 ° backward tilt on media containing various concentrations of polyamines as indicated. root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment. no significant root length differences were observed for any treatment other than cadaverine ( p < 0. 05, student ’ s t - test ). the ws wild type and oct1 - 1 had similar root lengths on. media containing the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine."
702,Transgenic lines were introduced into oct1 - 1 mutants and their relative root lengths were measured. a range of cadaverine resistance levels that did not correlate with the accession source of the transgene was found. genes other than oct1 probably also contribute to the cadavine response.
703," oct1 expression was measured in two other accessions, one resistant to cadaverine ( knox - 18 ) and one sensitive to it ( sq - 8) Both lines had higher oct1. expression than l er even though only knox. - 18 was more resistant to. l er root length is highly sensitive to cADAverine, whereas columbia root. length is less sensitive. ectopic copies of oct1 derived from. cvi or l er were also introduced into Columbia and l er wild - type plants."
704," arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession. by comparing phenotypes and gene expression in natural accessions, a mutant, and transgenic lines, oct1 was identified as a key gene involved in this response. restoring oct1 expression in the mutant background resulted in a positive correlation betweenOct1 expression levels and cADAverine resistance."
705,Cadaverine affects arabidopsis root morphology and there is natural variation in this response due in part to varying expression levels of oct1. future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. this work has potential implications for better understanding how polyamines contribute to development and mediate stress responses.
706, annexin 1 ( atann1 ) was one of those up - regulated rapidly after heat - shock treatment. Atann1 is important in regulating the heat - induced increase in [ ca 2 + ] cyt and in the response of arabidopsis seedlings to heat stress.
707, xyloglucan is a polysaccharide that has important roles in the formation and function of the walls that surround growing land plant cells. depleting galactose from the cell wall poly Saccharide xylglucan leads to a disruption of diverse cellular and physiological processes involved in normal plant growth.
708,The study shows that altering xyloglucan side chain structure disturbs diverse cellular and physiological processes. galactosylation in normal xylglucan function and demonstrates that altering this structure disrupts diverse cellular processes. The study was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.
709,"Bone health and cardiovascular function are compromised in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2DM ) The purpose of the present study was to determine whether skeletal vascular control mechanisms are altered during the progression of t2dm in the zucker diabetic fatty ( zdf ) rat. responses of the principal nutrient artery ( pna ) of the femur from obese zdf rats with prediabetes, short - term diabetes, and long -term diabetes were determined."
710,"Oocytes of the african clawed frog ( xenopus laevis ) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked. Recent advances have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanossensitive channels."
711," exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone - resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. We determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease."
712,Total body irradiation ( gamma or heavy - ion ) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption. This is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.
713,"Astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation, including low - linear energy transfer ( let ) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high - let radiation. simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total volume. The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast numbers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae."
714," radiation exposure transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteoclasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces. within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface ( bfr / bs ) is unaffected. radiation - induced changes in bone formation are more likely to contribute to later remodeling deficits rather than acute bone loss."
715," radiation exposure induces expression of pro - osteoclastogenic, pro - inflammatory, and antioxidant genes. These changes are likely to contribute to later cancellous bone loss. These molecular changes precede ( < 3 days ) the manifestation of bone loss ( 3 – 7 days ) following iron irradiation at a dose relevant to fractionated radiotherapy or space missions."
716,"Mice were irradiated with 56 fe ions ( 600 mev ) or were sham irradiated ( 0 gy controls ) Then 7 days later bones were harvested and cancellous microarchitecture in the proximal tibia quantified ex vivo using 3d microcomputed tomography. Compared with sham controls, irradiation with 2 gy reduced bv / tv by 16 %, tb. n by 15 %, and showed a trend of increased tB. sp by 11%. This is consistent with previous reports."
717,"Iron irradiation increased expression of the rankl gene by 9. 2 - fold compared with sham - irradiated controls ( fig. 2 ). at this time point, transcripts of opg and mcp1 were not detected in the marrow ( data not shown ). radiation exposure did not alter tnf expression."
718,"Mrna expression was measured in bone marrow at 4 h or 1, 3, or 7 days after low - let gamma irradiation and in sham - irradiated controls. within 4 h, 2 gy gamma irradiated bone marrow elevated rankl in marrow by 2. 6 - fold over the sham. gene expression of opg was undetectable regardless of treatment ( data not shown ). subsequently, the expression of many genes of interest ( rankl, csf1, nfatc1, tnf, mcp1, and il6) transiently increased within 1 day and subsequently declined toward sham levels."
719,"Gamma irradiation increased gene expression in femoral and ti tissue. Pro - inflammatory genes tnf, mcp1, and il6 increased by 1. 7 - fold, 11. 9 - fold and 1. 6 - fold. Levels of nfe2l2 expression were strongly and positively correlated with the osteoclast - related genes nfatc1 ( p < 0. 05, r = 0. 89 ) and csf1. These data suggest that bone - embedded and / or lining cells contribute to osteoc last stimulation."
720,"Gamma irradiation increased gene expression in femoral and tibial tissue ( sans marrow ) by day 3. circulating levels of osteoclast - specific tracp 5b were measured at 1, 3, and 7 days after gamma irradiation and in sham controls. thus, circulating tracP 5b levels showed a similar time course, although lower in magnitude compared with skeletal gene expression for rankl and other pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines."
721," radiation - induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression ( ctk, acp5, nfatc1 ) and a serum biomarker ( tracp 5b levels) marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast - related genes."
722,"Iron irradiation elevated the ratio of rankl / opg in both the marrow and skeletal tissue by day 3. After gamma irradiation, the ratio was elevated in the marrow at 4 h and then again at day 7. These findings suggest an nfe2l2 - mediated increase in expression of antioxidant enzymes may dampen bone resorption responses to radiation."
723,"When a macrophage cell line ( raw264. 7 ) capable of differentiating into osteoclast - like cells after rankl treatment is exposed to ionizing radiation ( 2 gy gamma), gene expression levels rise for β3 integrin, an adhesion receptor that is important for osteoc last differentiation. In other in vitro work, irradiation with 2 or 4 gy increases rankl in differentiated, mc3t3 - e1 osteoblast -like cells ( yang and others 2013 )."
724,"We found that 2 gy gamma irradiation elevated circulating levels of osteoclast - specific tracp 5b protein, indicative of increased bone resorption. The radiation - induced elevation in serum tracP 5b returned to control levels by day 7 following exposure. We conclude that the observed time course of skeletal gene expression and serum resorptive markers suggest a 2 - stage process."
725,We conclude that the structural deficits arose from a spike in osteoclastogenic cytokine expression that follows exposure to ionizing radiation. limitations of this work include the dose rate used to model space radiation. It is an open question whether lower dose rate exposures that constitute true space radiation stimulate osteoclasts and bone loss to the same extent.
726,"N 6 - threonylcarbamoyl - adenosine ( t6a ) is one of the few rna modifications that is universally present in life. this modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most trnas that decode ann codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon – codon interactions. nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single - celled organisms."
727,"Electrical impedance myography ( eim) was used to assess the effects of spaceflight and hind limb unloading on muscle fiber atrophy and bone deterioration. In the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle ( sts - 135 ) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. in the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limbUnloading ( hlu ) for13 days."
728," methods in the first experiment, 6 mice were flown aboard the space shuttle ( sts - 135 ) for 13 days and 8 earthbound mice served as controls. in the second experiment, 14 mice underwent hind limb unloading ( hlu ) for 14 days. eim measurements were made on ex vivo gastrocnemius muscle. quantitative microscopy and areal bone mineral density were also performed."
729," reductions in the multifrequency phase - slope parameter were observed for both the space flight and hlu cohorts compared to their respective controls. for ground control and spaceflight groups, the values were 24. 7±1. 3° / mhz and 14. 1± 1. 6° /mhz, respectively. this parameter also correlated with muscle fiber size ( ρ = 0. 65, p =0. 011 ) for spaceflight and hind limb abmd for both groups."
730,"Plants exhibit rapid, systemic signaling systems that allow them to coordinate physiological and developmental responses throughout the plant body. Wave propagation of these signals is thought to include processes ranging from electrical and hydraulic networks to waves of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and cytoplasmic ca 2 + traveling through the plant. We conclude that, in the root, plant systemic signaling is supported by a ros - assisted calcium - induced calcium release mechanism."
731,"Little is known about interactions between muscle and bone during the removal and application of mechanical signals. We tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. during unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. during reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates."
732,"Strong correlations between muscle mass and bone mass have been found in cross - sectional as well as longitudinal studies. If muscle was a causal factor during bone development, then increased muscle mass should precede the majority of bone mineral accrual. However, substantial bone loss can precede equivalently detectable losses in muscle by nearly a decade."
733,"Unloading causes both sarcopenia and osteopenia in humans and animal models. Reambulation recovers, at least in part, these losses. Differences in genetic make - up between individuals, humans or mice have been shown to greatly influence the magnitude of the skeletal response to unloading and reambulation."
734,"Femoral diaphysis of both legs was scanned by in vivo micro - computed tomography ( µct ) at baseline, after the unloading period, and after the reambulation period. mid - diaphyseal cortical bone morphology was evaluated for cortical area, marrow area, and tissue mineral density. muscle and bone data were also obtained from 25 normally ambulating f2 mice."
735,"Genotyping and qtl mapping for this set of mice has been described previously [ 18, 21 ]. briefly, dna was prepared from tail tips and submitted to kbiosciences for single - nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) genotyping. phenotypes pertaining to longitudinal changes during unloading, and reambulation were included in the qtl analysis performed via the statistical software r / qtl."
736," qtl and possible qtl * qtl interactions identified from a single and pair wise qtl scan were fit into multiple regression models. minimal and maximal changes in any given phenotype during unloading and reambulation were reported as the 5 th ( min ) and 95 th percentile ( max ) of the experimental population. p - values for terms in the multiple regression model were determined. for all tests, statistical significance was set at p = 0. 05."
737,"The response of both tissues to the two experimental regimes varied greatly across individuals. body mass changes in these mice during unloading and reambulation were not correlated with changes in any of the phenotype outcome variables. unloading - muscle during 3wk of unloading, muscle area ( mu. ar ) declined ( p < 0. 001 ) on average by 9 % ( min : - 26 %, max : 9 % ) while in normally ambulating age - matched controls, mu. Ar did not change significantly."
738,"Figures 2 and 3 show relative changes in a ) muscle area, b ) cortical area, c ) marrow area, and d ) tissue mineral density. experimental mice averaged a 9 % increase ( p < 0. 001 ) in muscle area during reambulation. Two suggestive qtls for the gain of muscle area upon reambulating were identified on chromosomal loci that differed from qtl identified for unloading."
739," bone unloading of the hindlimb reduced ( p = 0. 04 ) cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis on average by 0. 5 % ( min : - 6 %, max : 12 % ) while age matched controls gained 3 % ( p < 0. 001 ) over the same time period. bone marrow area increased by 6 % during unloading, a response that was significantly different from age matched control responses."
740,Only weak correlations were found between unloading and reambulation for changes in any given variable. No significant qtls were identified for any of the three bone variables. associations between changes in muscle area and cortical area resulted in r 2 - values of less than 10 %. extending the correlations between muscle and cortical bone to changes in trabecular bone produced similar results.
741,"For unloading, the qtl for changes in muscle area on chromosome 5 did not overlap with those identified for cortical indices but shared common regions with previously determined trabecular qtls from the same bones. for reambulation, the two suggestive qtLS for changes. in muscle areas on chromosomes 2 and 19 did not overlapped with ( suggestive ) qtles identified for. cortical indices."
742,The magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. The lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. The data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response. The low correlations are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle - bone unit that co - regulates its size.
743,There was a relatively small number of mice that added muscle and / or bone tissue during unloading. It is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice to go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. muscle - bone interactions have recently received considerable attention.
744,"Our results do not disprove the general concept of a functional muscle - bone unit. they do, however, provide evidence for a lack of functional and / or genetic co - regulation of bone and muscle during unloading and reambulation in this genetically diverse mouse population. our results emphasize that much work is required for a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle and bone interact."
745,"All authors approved the final version of the submitted manuscript. All authors contributed to the design and analysis of the data. The manuscript was edited by sj, wz, lrd, and eo. The final version was approved by all authors. The study was published in the online edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association."
746,"The squid - vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts : effacement and repolarization. symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization."
747,"Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is essential for normal bone growth, maturation, and turnover. peripheral actions of leptin occur at lower serum levels of the hormone than central actions. entry of leptin into the central nervous system ( cns ) is limited due to its saturable transport across the blood brain barrier."
748,"Eukaryotes have evolved a set of signaling mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response ( upr ) to increase the folding capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum. this process is particularly important in plants, because their sessile nature commands adaptation for survival rather than escape from stress. as such, plants make special use of the upr."
749,"Female mice are often used as preclinical models for osteoporosis but, in contrast to humans, mice exhibit cancellous bone loss during growth. mice are routinely housed at room temperature ( 18 – 23°c ), a strategy that exaggerates physiological differences in thermoregulation between mice and humans."
750,Female c57bl / 6j and c3h / hej mice were housed at either 22 °c or 32°c for up to 18 weeks. methods growing ( 4 - week - old ) female c57Bl / 6J and c4J / 6h mice.
751,C57bl / 6j mice housed at 22°c experienced a 62 % cancellous bone loss from the distal femur metaphysis during the interval from 8 – 18 weeks of age. C3h / hej mice exhibited a similar skeletal response. beneficial effects of thermoneutral housing were associated with decreased ucp1 gene expression in brown adipose tissue and higher rates of bone formation.
752,"In this article we report the identification of t - dna ( transfer dna ) insertion sites within two different gene regions in the genome of an arabidopsis mutant line, salk _ 084889. The positions are in the 3 ′ utr ( untranslated region ) of dreb2a ( dehydration - responsive element - binding protein 2a ) and promoter of lox1 ( lipoxygenase 1 ) as determined by dna - pcr."
753,In hyphae this compound is converted to aspulvinones whereas in conidia it is converted. to melanin. the genes are expressed in different tissues and this spatial control is probably regulated by their own specific promoters. our data reveal the first case in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in which the tissue specific production of a single compound directs it into two separate pathways.
754,"Aspergillus species are well known producers of secondary metabolites ( sms ) with interesting biological activities. The number of putative sm genes greatly exceeds the number of identified sms, suggesting many novel types of sms still remain to be discovered. In general, these sm genes are clustered in the genome. A typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton."
755,"The a. terreus genome contains 14 nrps - like genes with predicted a - t - te or similar domain architecture. One of these genes, atmela, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus. The diversity of nrPS - like products is expanded by a combination of different a domains ( substrate selection and activation ) and te domains ( various cyclization and release mechanisms)"
756,Study suggests an unprecedented pathway for conidial pigment biosynthesis in a. terreus that incorporates an nrps - like product aspulvinone e ( 1 ) as its substrate. our data also demonstrated how the sm diversity can be expanded by allocating the same natural product in different fungal compartments to produce molecules with different functions.
757,Heterologous expression of the nrps - like genes apva and atmela in a. nidulans both result in aspulvinone e production. The gene apva is responsible for aspulpvinone biosynthesis while the other is involved in the synthesis of the brown conidial pigment.
758,"Aspulvinone e ( 1 ) and its related natural products can be detected in lc / ms traces bi, bii, biii, ciii, di, dii, and diii. trace amount of 1 identified in d iii is due to the diffusion of this compound synthesized in the conidia of the mutant strain. this metabolite is related with aspulvanones according to its uv absorption and ms spectrum."
759,"The melanin pathway originates from the nrps - like product aspulvinone e ( 1 ), which is unlike the two main precursors [ di - hydroxyphenylalanin ( dopa ) and dihydroxynaphthalene ( dhn ) ] of currently known melani. limited information is available about the biosynthesis of the brown conidial melanin in a terreus."
760,Aspulvinone e ( 1 ) is unlike the two main precursors [ di - hydroxyphenylalanin ( dopa ) and dihydroxynaphthalene ( dhn ) ] of currently known melanins. The biosynthesis of dopa melanin starts with a tyrosine that is oxidized to either dopa or dopaquinone ( daq ) by a tyosinase. We speculate that a similar tyrosinase might catalyze the hydroxylation of 1 at the ortho position to give a diHydroxylated intermediate that becomes incorporated into brown melanin.
761,"Aspulvinone e ( 1 ) from the two genes might be generated in different fungal tissues. Since removal of atmela or atmelb changes the phenotype of a. terreus conidia ( fig. 3a ), it is likely that aspulvones from apva might be produced in conidia. likewise aspulpones, derived from 1 that is produced by apva, may be produced inside the hyphae and secreted into the medium."
762,"We examined whether apva could replace atmela in brown melanin biosynthesis. We assumed that tailoring enzymes like atmelb could still recognize aspulvinone e ( 1 ) generated from either apva or atmeca. quantitative analysis of their expression using real - time qrt - pcr reveals that the expression level of apva, which is under the control of atm Angela's promoter, is lower than that of Atmela."
763,"Both the melanin pathway and aspulvinones biosynthetic pathways are active when a. terreus is cultivated on lcmm agar. We hypothesized that atmelap would turn on the expression of gFP specifically inside the conidia while the gfp regulated by apvap would display a green fluorescent signal in the hyphae. To test our hypothesis, we generated two mutants in which the coding regions of apva and atmela were replaced by the green fluorescent protein coding sequence ( gFP)"
764,This is probably due to cell - type - specific expression of the two genes apva and atmela. ( 1 ) is likely due to the cell- type - Specific expression of both genes. ( 2 ) is probably because of the cell - Type - Specific Expression of the Two Genes Apva and Atmela ( 1)
765," melanin plays an important role in fungal pathogenesis as well as in the protection of the producing organisms from ultraviolet radiation. No definite structures for melanins have been elucidated due to their large molecular weight, insolubility in aqueous or organic solvents, and heterogeneity. Our study suggests that metabolite diversity can be expanded by spatial regulation of the same precursor biosynthesized by two distinct genes."
766," apva is inserted into a conserved genome region consisting of genes that are essential for fungal survival. atmela shares 73 % sequence similarity with apva. the production of aspulvinone - type sms by a. terreus, in response to general stress, could be related to the chromosomal location of its producing gene."
767,"Atmelap is capable of turning on the expression of both apva ( sm gene ) and the gFP ( reporter gene ), suggests that it might be a useful tool for directing the expression. of genes specifically inside of conidia. besides spatial regulation of the intermediate, the sm diversity can be further expanded, as shown in our study, through tailoring enzymes that are capable of modifying sms."
768,"All individual nrpks in a. nidulans generate a unique pks product. of different core intermediates. These nrps - like enzymes, with a - t - te domain architecture, fall within clade i of the phylogenetic tree ( fig. s5 † ). they are capable of synthesizing natural products with various chemical scaffolds."
769,"The two pks genes ausa and trt4 synthesize the same intermediate 3, 5 - dimethylorsellinic acid. 34 example, in the biosynthesis of the meroterpenoids austinol ( a. nidulans ) and terretonin (a. terreus )"
770,A. terreus deploys an additional strategy to enrich its natural product pool. The same precursor aspulvinone e ( 1 ) is shared in two pathways. The tissue specific expression of their biosynthetic genes results in the production of the same compound in different fungal tissues.
771,"Previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13. 5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Increased enrichment of aminoacyl - trna biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin - proteasome."
772,"Spaceflight is known to affect immune cell populations. splenic b cell numbers decrease during spaceflight. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after space flight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. next generation sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires."
773," b. subtilis cells were cultivated in biological research in canister - petri dish fixation units ( bric - pdfus ) on two separate missions to the international space station. No statistically significant difference in either growth or in the frequency of mutation to rif r was found in either experiment. However, nucleotide sequencing of the rpob gene from mutants revealed dramatic differences in the spectrum of mutations between flight ( fl ) and ground control ( gc ) samples."
774,"A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stresses in microbes can alter both the mutation rate and the mutagenic spectrum. This phenomenon, dubbed stress - induced mutagenesis ( sim), has been most eloquently demonstrated in the recent work of maharjan and ferenci. sim may play in the emergence of antibiotic resistance or modifications to the astronaut microbiome."
775," nasa has implemented a three - phase approach to its long - term goal of the human exploration of mars 1. The first phase, to be accomplished in the present - to - mid - 2020 ’ s time frame, is dubbed the “ earth reliant ” phase. Research aboard the international space station ( iss) is currently the only microgravity platform for the long -term testing of crew health systems."
776," resistance to rifampicin derives from mutations within a small region of the rpob gene. This region corresponds to the rif binding site of β ( campbell et al., 2001 ) and is highly conserved among prokaryotes. It is thus possible that mutation to r if could alter the response of microbes to the spaceflight environment."
777," temperature data were logged at 10 - min intervals during the fl and gc experiments and a summary of the data is presented in table 3. in the bric - 18 experiment, cells grew to average total cfu per pdfu of 3. 98 × 10 6 ( fl ) and 1. 10 × 10 7 ( gc ) ; these values were determined not to be significantly different."
778,"B. subtilis fl and gc samples were analyzed using non - parametric statistics. mutation frequencies to rif r in fl vs. gc. samples were determined. in the bric - 18 experiment, cells exhibited an average mutation frequency of 6. 9 × 10 - 6 ( fl ) and 7. 54 × 10- 6 ( gc ) ; these values were determined to be not significantly different. However, statistical comparison of the mutation frequencies. to rIf r obtained between the bri - 18 and bric. 21 flights revealed that cells demonstrated a significantly higher frequency of mutation to rIF r in the. bric-18 experiment ( p < 0. 007"
779,"The n - cluster and clusters i, ii, and iii of the rpob gene were pcr amplified from b. subtilis strain 168 and from the rif r mutants. nucleotide sequences were determined from a total of 56 fl and 15 gc samples from bric - 18. The data are summarized graphically in figure 3. examination of the data revealed several striking differences in the mutational spectrum between the fl and gC samples."
780,"The only mutation conferring rif r previously identified in the n - cluster of b. subtilis rpob was a g - to - t transversion causing the amino acid change v135f. In the present experiments, the v 135f mutation was observed only in bric - 21 gc samples. A novel mutation, q137r, was detected in then - cluster in 4 out of 56 bric-18 fl samples, but in none of the gc sample. This novel mutation was confirmed by retransformation and resequencing."
781,"The most common amino acid changes in cluster i leading to rif r occur at amino acids q469, h482, and s487. In our experiments, the spectrum and frequency of mutations appeared to be similar at these three amino acids. However, in fl samples from the bric - 21 experiment we found a large number of mutations ( 32 / 72 ) at l489, consisting exclusively of t - to-c transitions."
782,"A large number of mutations ( 32 / 72 ) at l489, consisting exclusively of t - to - c transitions resulting in the amino acid change l489s, were found in 2 fl pdfus. The spaceflight environment may be conducive to its formation ( tables 5, 6 ). in addition to amino acids q469, h482, s487, and l489 we found within cluster i two differences in the spectrum of mutations in rpob. first, at amino acid d472, we observed no mutations in fl samples, but in bric - 18 gc samples we observed two different mutations."
783,"No mutation in rpob was found by sequencing the classic n - cluster or clusters i, ii, and iii ( table 4 ). this phenomenon has been reported before ( ahmad et al., 2012 ) and raises 2 formal possibilities. because these mutants appeared in fl pdfus, they may represent new allele and warrant further investigation."
784," differences were observed in the location of rpob mutations in fl vs. gc samples in b. subtilis rif r mutants. rif binds in the concave surface of a roughly bowl - shaped depression in the rna exit channel of Rpob. amino acids q469, f470, d472, h482, r485, and s487 make direct h - bonds with rif ( campbell et al., 2001 )"
785,"Mutations at these positions led to rif r in fl and gc samples. amino acids in the n - cluster do approach the rif - binding pocket, but not within the 6 a distance depicted in figure 5. substitution of amino acids containing relatively small side groups with bulkier side groups can exert longer - range effects by distorting the binding pocket."
786,"Bacillus subtilis cells were grown in bric and bric-21 canisters in space. Growth, mutation frequency and spectrum of mutations were measured. No significant difference was found between spaceflight and 1 × g conditions. The human spaceflight environment in low earth orbit is characterized by an increased flux of high - energy particles."
787,"In two prior studies, the mutation frequency was either found not to be different in fl vs. gc ( yatagai et al., 2000 ) or to be elevated - fold in fl samples ( fajardo - cavazos and nicholson, 2016 ). The results described here, from 2 separate spaceflight missions to the iss, showed that the frequency of mutation to rif r in b. subtilis was not significantly different inFl vs gc samples. especially noteworthy were the mutations at q137r and l489s which were identified only in fl."

789,"Mice were euthanized on board the spacex - 4 mission in september 2014. Results showed no changes in the cytoskeletal protein content in the cardiac and lung tissue of the mice. There were significant changes in mrna expression levels of the associated genes, which may be due to an increase in total genome methylation."
790,"Under microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. Despite the decrease in the functional capabilities of the myocardium under conditions of microgravity, structural changes have not been observed after landing. It was shown by live - cell imaging that poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells ( ftc - 133 ) developed less aggressive phenotypes under microgravity."
791,"The effects of microgravity on gene expression have been documented in mammalian cells and other model organisms, such as yeast and bacteria. The mechanisms underlying these effects are still unclear. There is a substantial amount of conflicting data regarding the effects of space flight on cell structure and the regulation of transcription, which may be due to varying periods between landing and biomaterial fixation."
792,"We tested the protein and mrna levels of the same cytoskeletal proteins. We also analyzed one of the possible factors affecting gene expression, total dna methylation and its regulation. The biomaterial was fixed under space flight conditions in the us orbital segment of the iss. bion - m1 mission."

799,"Long duration microgravity does not lead to notable changes in cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue. The influence of the changes in external mechanical conditions, particularly gravity changes, on the cells of organisms that have evolved in earth ’ s gravity conditions is still poorly understood. Previous experiments conducted under space flight conditions were limited by the fact that the biomaterial of the flight animals could only be fixed after landing."
800,There was a decrease in the beta - actin protein and mrna expression levels in the flight group. The corresponding gene expression was reduced by 18 % [ 13 ]. comparison of the data obtained from the rr - 1 experiment with the data of the bion - m biosatellite experiment suggests that long - term space flight leads to a decrease. in the cytoplasmic fraction of cardiac proteins.
801,"We found no changes in the mrna contents of genes encoding the isoforms of actin and tubulin. The protein contents were also unchanged. cytoskeleton changes, observed in the early period of readaptation, can subsequently affect myocardial function. We can suggest that the development of protective measures could possibly focus on preparing for landing."
802,"In the absence of changes in the alpha - actinin - 1 mrna content, the protein content in the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes decreased. In the lung tissue, however, the alpha-actinin-1 protein content remained at control levels. This finding suggests an increase of translation efficiency and a decrease in the efficiency of the proteolysis of these proteins."
803,"Methylation in the mouse cardiac and lung tissue shifted to hypermethylation after a 37 - day space flight. The cause of the reduction of the mrna content of certain genes that encode cytoskeletal proteins remains unclear. Heavy ions radiation, which can make a difference in the space flight conditions, can contribute to the observed increase in the methylation level in the flight group."
804," de novo methylation can be mediated by histone deacetylation in the nucleosome area. Changes of methylation levels can result from increases in the methylase activity / content. We measured the mrna content of cytosine demethylases ( tet1, tet2, tet3 ) in the tested tissues. There were no changes in tet1 and tet3mna content."
805,"We measured the mrna content of cytosine demethylases ( tet1, tet2, tet3 ) in the tested tissues. There were no changes in tet1 and tet3 m rna content, but there was a significant decrease tet2 mrNA content in mouse cardiac and lungs tissues. We can only assume that the mechanism of the change in total methylation levels in the cardiac and lung tissue of mice was associated with the decrease in the tet2mrnacontent under space flight conditions."

819,"Parabolic flights are used to simulate space. The data will be used to refine g. algorithms, as well as refine expected g levels and support planning and analysis. due to the limited availability and high cost of actual space environments, it is imperative that we continue to utilize parabolic flights. by making our data and methods available we hope to enable others to better plan and execute parabolic flight experiments."

827,"Gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. detections of inertial acceleration, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception."
828,"The established reference of self - orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move. hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard shuttle orbiters. physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity."
829,"We manipulated the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity ( hg ) via centrifugation. We directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell - afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the same animal.

831,Results control responses to translational accelerations and tilts in normal gravity were studied. utricular afferent behavior in control fish to linear acceleration ( panels a – c ) and to tilt ( panel d ) is given in figure 3. orientation of the fish about the z - axis ( yaw position in a ) was set at 90° to provide a positive acceleration directed out the fish ’ s right ear.
832,"The afferent was tested for nearly 360° change in orientation at 21 separate head angles. The fitted nulled value of 0 for smin ( e. g., smin / smax = 0 in the example in figure 3c ) reflected the sharpness of directional tuning. smin was near a complete null ( 32 ips / ° ) response predicted from the smax to linear acceleration ( yellow line ) at both nose down ( pitch - n ) and tail down ( Pitch - t ) pitch tilts."
833,"Figures 3 and 4 show how responses were analyzed at 21 separate orientations of fish. A cosine function ( red curve) was applied to data to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum ( smax ) and its minimum ( smin) smax was 3234 ips / g at 90° ( comparable at 270° ) and afferent was highly spatially tuned. table 1 summarizes the principal findings."
834,"Average smax was 2103 ± 1314 ips / g. directional selectivity was tightly tuned. head angle at smax occurred at virtually all angles in 2d space ( ±180° ) in control fish, averaged 95 ± 82°. acceleration directed out the ipsilateral ear as expected for prevalence of afferents supplying the large medial extrastriola ( asterisk ) macula."
835,"Four groups of 16 days of exposure to 2. 24 g followed by 2, 4, 6, or 8 days of recovery in normal 1 g. Last group is standard laboratory control fish. columns provide the number of utricular afferents in each group. response smax of response at the afferent ’ s preferred direction ( in impulse / s / g, or ips / g ) smin of response over the smax as a measure of directional selectivity. head angle ( in degree, ° ) at smax ; and ir at Smax ( in impulses per second per cycle time). last three columns are data obtained from number of hc afferentS ( n ="

837,"Figure 5 shows correlation of response sensitivity and discharge properties in fish exposed to different levels of hg. figure 6 shows two afferent responses to static and dynamic tilt. sinusoidal tilts at 2 hz, ±0. 16°, were delivered over seven cycles at a head angle of 345°, within 22° ( and 15° from pure roll ) from the calculated head angle at smax."
838,"Tilt stimuli in the opposite direction, contralateral to recording site, silenced the afferent in both instances. Different control afferent has a response to dynamic, but not static, tilt displacements. responses to sinusoids and static tilts corresponded well in most tested afferents. There was considerable variability in response to static tilt."
839," utricular afferent response to evs activation was in general comparable to that observed in hc afferents in the same species ( boyle and highstein, 1990b ) as mentioned in the section “ materials and methods, ” we found that evsactivation was less prevalent in utricle than in hC recordings. The effective action of evs stimulation was a near doubling of ir from 37. 1 ± 23. 7 to 62. 8 ± 30. 5 ips."
840,"Figure 7 shows disruption of response to a 2 hz sinusoidal linear acceleration of ±24. 4 cm / s 2 ( or ±0. 025 g ) by evs activation via a shock train applied to the brainstem or self - generated by the fish itself. In the absence of evs. activation the afferent had an averaged response. modulation of ±6. 3 ips. That was temporarily altered by the brief epoch of. evs stimulation. when evs action was less pronounced, afferent rate was elevated."
841,"Electrical evoked ( a ) or self - generated ( b ) efferent vestibular system ( evs ) activation elevates afferent rate and reduces or even blocks its response to linear acceleration. In the absence of evs activation afferent showed an averaged response of 2 hz linear acceleration in the absence and presence of electrical evs stimulation. During cycles with combined evs. stimulation, modulation dropped by % to ±7. 4 ips, now centered about an elevated discharge rate of 51. 9 ips. averaged sensitivity was reduced by about one - half to 31.4 ips / °."
842," utricular afferent responses to acceleration in on - center - control ( occ ) condition during centrifugation. fish were exposed to either 4 or 16 days of rotation at 38 rpm. smax ( in ips / g ) of individual responses are plotted as a function of percent within each control group. Within the first day after landing, smax was significantly ( p < 0.01 ; ∗ ) greater than for controls."
843,"Within the first day after landing, smax ( red circles ) to an applied linear acceleration was significantly greater than for controls. sensitivity returned to near normal values after h following landing. smax was indistinguishable in the three control groups and revealed no influence of rotation alone on response behavior of utricular afferents."
844,Hc afferent ir was unaffected. horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were also unaffected by the experimental conditions ( q. v. supplementary figure 1 ). reaction was bi - phasic starting with a significant twofold increase in smax after 3 ( n = 228 afferents ) and peaked at 4. utricular afferent. responses to acceleration and tilt following 2. 24 g exposure principal reaction to hg was an adjustment of response sensitivity as a function of the magnitude and duration of exposure.
845,The reaction was bi - phasic starting with a significant twofold increase in smax after 3. smax peaked at 4 ( n = 153 afferents ) days of exposure to 2. 24 g. smin / smax ratio remained the same on average for all populations within and across the wide range in experimental conditions.
846," utricular afferents exhibited a profound hypersensitivity when tested to translation upon return to earth after 9 – 16 days of microgram exposure on two shuttle orbiter missions and a recovery back to normal after several days ( boyle et al., 2001 ). these data are given in the percent plot in figure 9a. nearly 60 % of the afferentS tested within 10 – 16 h after landing ( solid red circles ) were significantly ( p < 0. 005 ) more sensitive than control Afferents."
847,"Smax recovered within normal levels at the 5 - and 8 - day tests before a significant smax reduction was observed after 16 – 32 days of 2. 24 g exposures. responses in these exposures unmistakably resembled those seen initially after space travel and were unexpected. afferent characteristics across the three ( 16 -, 24 -, and 32 - day ) groups displaying a smax hyposensitivity was statistically similar."
848,"Figure 10b provides a summary histogram ( same format as figure 10a ) of smax in afferent populations initially exposed to 4 or 16 days of 2. 24 g and returned to 1 g until a restoration of normal activity was established. early hypersensitivity observed after 4 days at 2.24 g took > 4 days to recover to control levels, and the later hyposensitivity. observed after 16 days at2. 24 G recovered more quickly and required > 2 days in 1 g to recover. to control level. thus, the bi - phasic hyper - to hypo - sensitivity to translations after centrifugation reflected an adaptive process that was restorable with a delay to its"
849,"The afferent response to evs pulses after 4 days at 2. 24 g was more prevalent with 62. 3 % responding with significantly greater δevs ( 43. 8 ± 38. 1 ips ) than that for control afferents. At the 32 - day mark, evs action was greatly enhanced, but again the action is not consistent with the significant smax increase. It is not possible to establish direct causality of afferent ir and response behavior after hg exposures."
850,"Hair cell sb counts in the same fish from which afferent responses were obtained. Number of sb per 100 μm 2 was determined for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line in the striola and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola. On average sb count per hair cell was 4 – 7 in each experimental group, and ranged in number from 1 to 13 in each group."
851,The average ir ( in ips / cycle ) during acceleration at smax also differed between afferents in these groups. rate was significantly lower in the 16 - day group than in the control group. The number of synaptic bodies per hair cell was determined using 3d computerized serial reconstruction techniques at transmission electron microscopy level from 150 sections of 180 nm thickness.
852,"Toadfish utricular afferents showed a wide range of discharge rates, regularity of discharge, and response sensitivity to sinusoidal linear acceleration with a typically tight degree of directional selectivity. The physical basis for differences in response dynamics is not fully understood. determining the precise signals originating from different regions of the utricular macula and how these signals enter central otolith reflex pathways have been a challenge."
853,"Like the chinchilla, toadfish medial extrastriola occupies about three - fourths of the total macula area. Three-fourths of the afferents recorded in this study are more irregularly discharging. We know that changes occur during adaptation to microgram and re - adaptation to 1 g upon return to earth."
854,In orbit space stations provide a platform to extend human presence in space and capture the physiological response ( s ) to longer duration of exposures. adaptation to microgram is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the prevailing gravity. do the processes of adaptation tomicrogram in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a plateau or continue to evolve in time?
855,Hc afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of hg in the same fish. occs performed at 4 - or 16 - day exposure to 228° / s ( 38 rpm as in 2. 24 g runs ) constant angular velocity were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal afferent counterparts in non - rotated controls. video taken during the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during the different exposures.
856,"Gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric, despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase in gain of the angular vestibulo - ocular reflex. otolith afferent discharge appeared to increase within the first 3 days of the orbital mission and returned to normal at day 5."
857,Transducer changes might lead to an adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials. otolith weight by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that affects mechanotransduction. The onset and time course of transducer adaptation might be both rapid and long - lasting.
858,"A widely considered candidate. for the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity of hair cell ribbon synapses ( moser. et al., 2006 ). number of ribbon. synapses in certain type ii hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55 % following exposure to. microgram. However, more recent evidence by sultemeier et. al. ( 2017 ) in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells."
859,"The time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures is an important piece of relevant evidence. We found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and hc cristae. This discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent."
860,"In the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4 - or 16 - day of 2. 24 g exposures. hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large. afferent smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal."
861,"It is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent ( evs ) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. does the evs participate in the adaptive processes observed after exposures to hg? We addressed this question indirectly in this study by inferring evs action on the hair cell by comparing smax observed in each experimental group."
862,"A more direct measure to determine evs role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. efferent vestibular system functional role in nonmammalian vertebrates is likely linked to innate behaviors. in toadfish these actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase."
863,"Recent evidence showed that the evs could influence vor plasticity using the α9 knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one labyrinth. No direct measurements or indirect inferences from afferent discharge behavior were found here to suggest a clear evs role in regulating the utricular response to altered gravity. The information content provided by the efferent feedback signal in diverse conditions may be more complex."
864," transcriptome analysis has been performed on diverse tissues harvested from animals flown in space, but not the kidney. Both liver and kidney overexpressed genes in the same four areas. understanding genome wide, tissue - specific, and spaceflight - induced changes in gene expression is critical to develop effective countermeasures."
865,"The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment. This is of particular concern under conditions such as disuse, paralysis, and extended - duration space flight. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the collagen composite tissue."
866," sequencing antibody repertoires has steadily become cheaper and easier. sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed pcr prior to sequencing. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more v - gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire."
867,"Animal – microbe associations are critical drivers of evolutionary innovation. The origin of specialized symbiotic organs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the genome of euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod, and observed large - scale genomic reorganizations compared with the ancestral bilaterian genome."
868, space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts ’ cardiac health. microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male c57bl / 6 mice followed - up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mgy of 1 gev proton or 150mgy of  n 56 fe were compared to human endothelial cells cultured for 7 days on the international space station. We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and huvecs flown on the iss.
869,This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of both total and intact / viable bacteria and fungi found on surfaces in closed space systems. It can be used to help develop safety measures that meet nasa requirements for deep space human habitation. The dominant organisms are associated with the human microbiome and may include opportunistic pathogens.
870,"The online version of this article ( 10.1186 / s40168 - 019 - 0666 - x ) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.

871,"The international space station ( iss ) is the largest human space platform in low earth orbit ( ~ 400 km above earth ’ s surface ) and for the last 17 years it has been continuously inhabited by an international community of astronauts performing space research. microbes are known to survive and even thrive in extreme environments, and the microbes that are present on the iss may have existed since the inception of the iss while others may be introduced each time new astronauts or payloads arrive."
872,"Microbes in indoor spaces have been shown to impact human health by influencing our susceptibility to allergies, infectious diseases, or sick building syndrome. The influence of the indoor microbiome on human health becomes more important for astronauts during flights due to altered immunity associated with space flight. In light of an upcoming new era of human expansion in the universe, such as future space travel to mars, the microbiome of the closed space environment needs to be examined thoroughly."
873,This comprehensive analysis of the iss microbiome was used to assess how microbial communities change over time. The implementation of novel molecular techniques to monitor intact microbial populations in this unique environment opens a possibility for broadening the current surveillance practices to maintain the health of the crew. This could promote advances in deep space human habitation in the future.
874,"Twenty - four surface wipes were collected from eight locations across the iss during three flight missions over the course of 14 months. amplicon sequencing detected more bacterial phyla when compared to the culture - based analyses, but both methods identified similar numbers of fungal phyla. changes in bacterial and fungal load ( by culture and qpcr ) were observed over time but not across locations. There were no significant differences in community composition and richness after propidium monoazide sample treatment."
875,"Nodes are us modules that connect the elements of the iss node 1, called unity, was the first us - built element that was launched. node 1 has 6 ports that provide berthing connections to other modules, iss infrastructure, and visiting cargo. node 2, called harmony, connects the us, european, and japanese laboratories. node 3, called tranquility, is attached to the port side of node 1 and provides accommodation for life support and exercise equipment."
876,"The us laboratory module, called destiny, is the primary research facility for us payloads. The module hosts 24 equipment racks for accommodation and control of iss systems and scientific research in physical and biological sciences. The permanent multipurpose module, pmm, hosts up to 16 stowage racks containing equipment, experiments, and supplies."
877,"This is the first study to utilize culture, qpcr, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the us segment. It revealed a diverse intact / viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations. The predominant organisms on iss surfaces consisted of those that are associated with humans."
878,"The ISS has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. 46 % of intact / viable bacteria and 40 % of alive fungi could be cultured with the culture media used during this study. many of the organisms detected on the iss are known to form biofilms that belong to both bacterial ( acinetobacter, sphingomonas, bacillus, burkholderia, corynebacterium, and klebsiella) and fungal ( penicillium, aspergillus, cryptococcus, and rhodotorula ) genera."
879,"Methylobacterium, sphingomonas, bacillus, penicillium, and aspergillus have been implicated in microbial - induced corrosion on earth. The role they play in corrosion aboard the iss remains to be determined. members of the family staphylococcaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the most predominant organisms on iss surfaces."
880,"The family staphylococcaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the most predominant organisms on iss surfaces. These taxa are also abundant in fitness centers, office buildings and hospitals. This suggests that the iss is similar to other built environments on earth, in that its microbiome is shaped by human occupation."
881,"Location # 6 ( permanent multipurpose module [ pmm ] port 1) exhibited low concentrations of cultivable ( fig. 2 ), viable ( fig, 3 a ), and total ( data not shown ) microbial burden. sporidiobolaceae family was found in high relative abundance across the iss with amplicon sequencing. this organism can survive inside dishwashers despite high temperatures and chemical exposure."
882,"Nine out of the ten most relatively abundant family level taxa differed over the three flights. temporal differences may be due to the different occupants onboard the iss during each of the flight sampling session. earth indoor microbiome studies have shown that humans shed microbes to indoor surfaces upon contact, playing a pivotal role in shaping the indoor microbiome."
883,"All three flights were sequenced simultaneously and without multiple displacement amplification prior to sequencing. shotgun metagenome analysis carried out by singh et al. from the same samples revealed that reads associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid derivatives and cofactors, vitamins, etc. were the highest among all three flights. computational analyses showed that the legionella resistome, cobalt - zinc - cadmium resistance, and multi - drug resistant resistance efflux pump were high on all flights and all locations."
884,"This study on bacterial and fungal load and diversity across the iss provides a comprehensive catalog of what can be found in closed space systems. such as the iss will facilitate planning of future human habitation of moon, mars, and beyond. accumulation of intact / viable microbial cells in a confined environment poses a health risk to all inhabitants."
885,"High - dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor - derived hematopoietic stem cells."
886,"C57bl / 6j mice were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading ( hlu ) or remained full - weight bearing ( ground ). on day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 gy ( sham), 0. 1 gy, 0. 5 gy or 1. 0 gy. on day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. no significant differences were observed between hlu and / or radiation groups."
887,"Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground - sham. circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( scomp ), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups. early administration of low - dose irradiation ( 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 gy ) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days after irradiation."
888, extended spaceflight has been shown to adversely affect astronaut visual acuity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. ten week old adult c57bl / 6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to earth alive.
889,"Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized. 40 % of astronauts have experienced sans, including the spaceflight subject of the nasa twins study. The physiological impact of sans encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening and nerve fiber layer infarcts."
890,Mouse retina exposed to spaceflight. environment for 35 days aboard the international space station ( iss ) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed. to space flight. The study was part of the International Space Station (ISS) program.
891,"10 - week - old male c57bl / 6 mice ( n = 20 ) ( jackson laboratories, inc. bar harbor, me ) were flown for nasa ’ s ninth rodent research experiment ( rr - 9 ). the mice lived in nasa’s rodent habitats ( rh ) aboard iss for 35 days before returning to earth via spacex ’s dragon capsule. all mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26 – 28 °c with a 12 - h light / dark cycle during the flight."
892,Right eyes from 2 experimental groups : ground control and spaceflight ( n = 8 mice per group ) were dissected to obtain the retina. retinas were flash - frozen and stored at −80 °c for genomic analysis. immunostaining assays and histology paraffin - embedded sections ( six µm ) of left eye were used for analysis.
893,"The number of pna - positive cells were counted in three sections of tissue from each animal using image j counting plugin 1. 41 software ( national institutes of health, bethesda, md ; http : / / rsbweb. nih. gov / ij / ). counts were averaged across each group. to determine hne immunoreactivity, fluorescence intensity was measured on 5 randomly selected fields on each section."
894," retina, rpe layer, choroid and sclera were performed in the middle slice of the sagittal view of each sample using the optical nerve as reference. Three measurements were recorded of each structure to finally obtain an average. retina tissues ( n = 8 / group ) were homogenized with precellys ckm beads ( hilden, germany ) in 600 µl of rlt plus buffer. Total rna and dna were extracted using the qiagen allprep dna / rna / mirna universal kit."
895,"Libraries of different indices were pooled for sequencing together in equimolar amounts. pooled libraries were quantified by qubit prior to sequencing. for sequencing, clusters were generated on cbot with hiseq3000 / 4000 pe cluster kit ( illumina, inc., san diego, ca ) from 5 ul of 2 nm final library pool. sequencing was performed on an illumina hiseq4000 ( loma linda university center for genomics ) using 75 cycles sbs reagents. single - indexed and single - end reads with 75 nucleotides length ( 1 × 75 bp ) were generated. fastq files generated from the sequence run were demultiplexed and mapped against mouse"
896," heatmaps were generated using the webtool morpheus, from the broad institute. degs that are transcription factors were annotated using the panther database version 14. 1 19. go, gene network analysis, and phenotype graphs were created by performing an overrepresentation enrichment analysis using webgestalt 12. go analysis was carried out using biological process database."
897,Twenty mice spent 35 days on the international space station as part of nasa ’ s ninth rodent research experiment ( rr - 9 ). an additional twenty mice were housed on earth in the same housing hardware used in flight for the ground control group. rna sequencing was performed on sixteen mice ( n = 8 / group ). 600 differentially expressed genes ( degs ) were identified between the spaceflight and ground control groups using deseq2 11 with an adjusted p - value threshold of 0. 01.
898,"An overrepresentation analysis ( ora ) of gene ontology ( go ), pathway, and phenotypic categories was performed on the degs using webgestalt 12. from this analysis, 46 go, 5 pathway and 14 phenotyping categories were found with a false discovery rate ( fdr ) of less than 0. 05 ( fig. 1b – d, sup. table 2 ). included in the overrepresented categories are categories related to ocular function. drd4 was the most significantly differentially expressed gene and was upregulated in the spaceflight group."
899,"Drd4 is a dopamine receptor that control circadian rhythm in the mammalian retina. hist1h2bc has been previously shown to be upregulated in the aging retina. Together, these genes support previous studies suggesting that spaceflight disrupts circadian rhythms and is a potential model for aging."
900,"Of the 75 genes associated with retinitis pigmentosa, 12 were differentially expressed during spaceflight ( sag, bc027072 / pcare, guca1b, rbp3, ahi1,. guca 1a, prpf8, rp1, gucy2e, cacna2d4, pde6b, dhdds ), the most of any of the four retinal diseases examined. diabetic retinopathy had one disease - associated gene that was differentially express during space flight ( hif1a ). age - related macular degeneration and retinal detachment disease -associated genes were not differentially expression during spaceFlight. differentially"
901,Eight of the detfs are necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye. of special interest are cazs1 and hif1a. cazS1 is a heterochromatin regulator that acts in a splice - variant specific manner 24. hif 1a inactivation has been shown to significantly mitigate photoreceptor degeneration in a chronic hypoxia - like stress model 25.
902,"Total retina, retinal pigment epithelium ( rpe ), and choroid layers of the eye decreased significantly in thickness ( p < 0. 05 ) during spaceflight. Choroid deformation and folds were noticed in spaceflight mice ( fig. 4c ). cone photoreceptors show signs of degradation during space flight."
903,"Cone photoreceptors show signs of degradation during spaceflight ( fig. 5a ). our quantitative assessment revealed a strong trend decrease in density of cones in the spaceflight mice ( 950 counts / mm 2 ) compared to ground control group. The occurrence of lipid peroxidation was evaluated with antibody against 4 - hydroxynonenal ( 4 - hne ), which is an indicative marker of oxidative damage to the retina. increased 4 -Hne staining was seen in cone photoreceptor, retinal inner nuclear layer ( inl ), and ganglion cell layer ( gcl ) after spaceflight compared toground controls."
904,"Fluorescent intensity profiles in the photoreceptor cones which reflects endogenous level of hne, was also significantly increased ( p < 0. 05 ) in the spaceflight group compared to the ground controls. The upregulation of pde8a and the downregulation of the hif1a and hgf are linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina."
905,"We found a distinct gene expression signature in the retina of mice exposed to the spaceflight environment compared with the ground control. This signature is enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Other studies have also shown changes of gene expression involved in cell structure, growth, migration and adhesion in the retinal cells exposed to simulated microgravity."
906,Several transcription factors were identified as necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye 20. 21 of the detfs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. finding an appropriate earth - based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight.
907,"Bnip3 is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell. heat shock genes hsp90aa1, hsp 90b1, and hspa4l are known to protect against oxidative stress. we also found evidence that the circadian rhythm of the retina was altered in spaceflight."
908,"Adcy1 produces cyclic amp, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors. circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where day / night light signals are irregular."
909," microct provides an easy and non - destructive technique to image without any modification. future work should use volumetric data to perform other analyses that take advantage of the micro - ct imaging capabilities. we have characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers."
910,"There remains much work to be done on understanding the mechanism of spaceflight - induced oxidative stress on retinal damage. We also believe these data will be useful for understanding other spaceflight- related health concerns, such as misregulation of the circadian rhythm and accelerated aging. a full list of degs has been provided as a resource ( sup. table 1 ) toward further understanding of associations between spaceflight, retinal function, and overall mammalian health."
911," bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses. While irradiation - induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non - enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x - ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae."
912,"Life on earth has evolved under the influence of gravity. this force has played an important role in shaping development and morphology. understanding gravitational effects requires changing the magnitude of this force. one method of eliminating gravity ' ’ s influence is to enter into a free - fall orbit around the planet, thereby achieving a balance between centripetal force of gravity and the centrifugal force of the moving object."
913,"Plants have evolved under the influence of earth ' ’ s gravity, a force of “ 1 g. ” this ubiquitous force affects plant growth, development, and morphology at all levels, from the molecular to the whole plant. experiments focusing on plant growth and development have been carried out in this environment almost from the advent of human spaceflight in the 1960s."
914,"Because of the scarcity of access to spaceflight, researchers have used other approaches to minimize or eliminate constant 1 - g conditions. These methods include drop towers ( samples are weightlessness for seconds ), parabolic flights in specialized airplanes and sounding rockets. Private companies such as blue origin and virgin galactic are promising suborbital flight with several minutes of microgravity."
915,"Study was conducted to determine if the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland is affected by microgravity and the spaceflight environment. No significant changes in protein expression occurred in female mice flown for 13 - 15 d. in male mice, however, increased labeling for salivary androgen binding protein alpha ( in acinar cell secretory granules ) was seen after 30 d in space."
916,"Nasa rodent models are useful for exploring the health consequences of prolonged spaceflight. capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on - board sample recovery. for nasa ’ s rodent research - 1 mission, female mice were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the international space station for 21 / 22d or 37d in microgravity. mice were euthanized on - orbit, livers and spleens dissected and remaining tissues frozen in situ for later analyses."
917,"All but two spaceflight rodent experiments have entailed sample collection only after return to earth. rodent space shuttle experiments conducted between 1965 and 2011 demonstrated extensive changes in the immune, musculoskeletal, and central nervous and cardiovascular systems. There is a pressing need for spaceflight hardware and operational systems to further explore the consequences of long duration space travel on rodents."
918,"There have been a limited number of long duration ( > 3 wk ), rodent spaceflight experiments. The longest duration experiment with rodents in space completed to date ( 91d ) in the european space agency ’ s mouse drawer system 9 revealed intriguing differences in oxidative damage to red blood cells 10 and skeletal decrements 11. recently, the japanese space agency performed important experiments with a newly developed flight hardware system supporting singly - housed mice, which can be centrifuged at 1 g."

920,"Female mice were selected for this mission for two reasons: first, because only female mice were flown on earlier missions that used the heritage aem group - housed hardware system. second, to avoid potential complications due to aggression which is more common in males than females. mice thrived in the housing, as assessed by behavior, body weights and organ mass ( adrenal, thymus, spleen ). further, samples dissected on - orbit yielded high quality rna and protein ( select liver enzyme activities ). recovery of livers dissected from frozen carcasses yielded rna with high rin values."
921," rodent research transporter and habitats performed as expected for the duration of the flight. there were no interruptions in power, lighting, airflow, or the delivery of food and water throughout the mission. temperature, humidity and gas levels varied within the compartments of the transporter and habitat along with the cabin environment."
922,"The rodent habitat was modified from heritage flight hardware ( aem ) to provide long - term housing for rodents aboard the iss. differences between the aem, developed and used for short - term space shuttle missions, and the habitat include long duration and secondary exhaust filters, water refill capability. Four video cameras ( supercircuits, austin, tx ) were used to monitor daily activity and animals’ health and behavior."
923," rodent habitat allows for water refills on - orbit to support long - duration missions of more than 30 days. video downlink from cameras, lights, and fans are functional prior to animal transfer. mouse transfer box with a 2 - door lid was created to hold and securely transfer up to 5 animals at a time between the transporter and habitat."
924,"Mice were housed in the transporter at a density of 20 mice per transporter ( 10 mice per side ) for 10 days to simulate the longest expected time of the transient phase between animal loading prior to launch and animal transfer on the iss to the habitats. at the end of the lst the mice were checked by the attending veterinarian and deemed to be healthy and suitable for experimental research. The data showed that the habitat supported 10 female, 16 wk old c57bl / 6j female mice for 32 days during the first test."
925,Mice were housed in standard vivarium cages at a density of 5 mice per cage. mice were implanted with imi - 1000 2 × 11 mm transponders. fecal samples were collected at 2 different time points : upon receipt at ksc and 11 days before turnover for launch.
926,"The mice were introduced to the nasa type 12 nutrient upgraded rodent foodbars ( nurfb ) 54, and at l - 18d to deionized, autoclaved water via water bottles outfitted with lixits. mouse igloos ( vwr, radnor, pa ) were provided to the mice for enrichment. food and water depletion was measured, via weight changes, every 3 – 4 days after mice were placed at double density."
927,"The mice were aged 16 weeks and 32 weeks of age for validation and experimental groups, respectively. experimental mice were similarly weight matched into basal, flt and gc groups and assessed by the av. from these 3 groups, at l - 3d, the flt group animals were assigned based on their health and body weights. The animals remained in the transporters for two days prior to launch. to prepare for launch, the dragon capsule atop the falcon9 rocket transitioned from horizontal to vertical position."
928,"Mice were housed at a density of 10 mice per habitat, 5 mice per side. while on - board the iss, animal health checks were performed daily as described below. mice were euthanized via intraperitoneal ( ip ) injection of euthasol ( virbac, fort worth, tx ) diluted with sterile saline ( 1 : 1 ) at 1. 72 mg / kg followed by cervical dislocation. the right hindlimb was dissected from 10 mice. the liver and spleen were collected from 5 wild - type mice and frozen at ≤−80 °c in a flight freezer ( the minus eighty degree laboratory freezer for iss, melfi ) or preserved in"
929,"Livers and spleens were dissected and preserved in rnalater ( thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma ) at 4 °c for about 2 days and then transferred to the melfi for freezing and storage until return to earth. The flight attending veterinarian was in attendance for all on - orbit euthanasia and dissection procedures and was able to visualize and communicate with the crew via real - time video and voice loop."
930,"The mice were loaded into the transporter at l + 1d. just prior to animal loading, the mice were checked by the ksc attending veterinarian, and they were deemed healthy and suitable for science. the transporter was kept in the isses to simulate the same environmental conditions the flt animals were exposed to. after 4 days inside the transporter, the validation and experimental gc mice were evaluated and then transferred to the habitats, where they were housed at a density of 10 mice per habitat."
931,"Rr - 1 validation mice were exposed to radiation for 37 days ( 4 days in transit and 33 days on the iss ). The dosimetry mapping of radiation levels across the u. s. lab indicated that during the 37 day period the daily dose was approximately 207 μgy / day and the total dose recorded by an instrument in the U.S. lab was 7. 377 mgy. Since the mice remained inside the radiation belts during transit, we estimated that the dose rate during transit was approximately the same as while on board the iss."
932,"Frozen tissue samples and carcasses were shipped from ksc to arc on dry ice then stored at −80 °c until they were processed about 4 months later. frozen carcasses of the validation mice were weighed upon receipt at arc, and the body weights of the 8 non - dissected mice from each group were compared to their respective weights at l - 3 days. tests performed prior to launch had confirmed that the long term freezing and partial thawing procedure did not affect measured body weights."
933,"Rna was extracted from the spleen and liver tissue samples from validation basal, viv, gc, flt, and positive control ( pc ) mice. Spleens and aliquots of livers were immediately preserved in rnalater, to serve as a positive control for tissue quality. tissues were stored at −80 °c immediately after freezing in liquid nitrogen. The total rna extracted for each tissue sample was converted to cdna using the high - capacity cdna reverse transcription kit."
934,Liver enzyme activity assays were carried out using 20 ng of cdna on a quantstudio 6 flex real - time pcr system ( thermo fisher scientific catalog # 4485694). gene expression in liver samples was normalized to the rpl19 ( all but cat ) or gapdh ( cat ) endogenous reference genes. Catalase activity was measured using the colorimetric assay and normalized to total protein levels.
935,"Gapdh activity levels were determined using the colorimetric gapdh assay kit ( sciencell research laboratories, carlsbad, ca). statistical significance was determined by comparing 4 and 3 groups from the same cohorts for the validation and experimental study. for validation mice, uniformity of variance was tested by levene ’ s test and normality goodness of fit by shapiro - wilk."
936,"Mice flown on the rr - 1 mission were designated as either nasa “ validation ” mice ( female c57bl / 6j, 16 wks ) or iss national lab “ experimental ’ mice. validation mice consisted of four groups to enable assessment of the contributions of age, cage configuration, and spaceflight. animal operations and tissue processing were carried out as described in supplementary table s1 and depicted in fig. 2."
937,"The c57bl strain from taconic was used as the corresponding wildtype strain for the murf1ko mice 14. attending veterinarian observations health checks were performed daily through the use of downlinked videos. validation flt mice showed increased overall physical activity ( eating, drinking, ambulating ) in microgravity compared to validation gc mice. spontaneous ambulatory behavior was commonly observed but did not interfere with the intake of food and water. no injuries of any kind were observed during spaceflight."
938," spaceflight increased animal activity. dark cycle that started at day 7 – 10 in microgravity, which was not observed at any time in the gc group. experimental flt mice also engaged in the running behavior albeit much less. no injuries of any kind were observed during the flight. additional detailed analysis was performed to quantify and analyze on - orbit behavior and activity 18."
939,"After validation flt and control animals were euthanized, 8 / 10 intact carcasses per group were wrapped, rapidly frozen, and stored at −80 °c. The indicated organs were dissected from the frozen carcasses of all validation groups, thawed and weighed. raw weights of each organ were quantified. statistical significance was determined by levene ’ s test for uniformity of variance and shapiro - wilk test for normality goodness of fit."
940,The soleus was the only one that showed significant differences in flt compared to gc ( supplementary fig. s2 ). spaceflight reduced soleus mass. the spleens and livers from gc animals weighed less than viv controls by 22 % and 19 % respectively. liver samples were analyzed for select enzyme activities and total rna was extracted from liver and spleen samples.
941,"Liver livers were dissected after 21 / 22 days in microgravity and frozen at −80 °c until recovery ( experimental mice, a ), or were recovered post - flight, after 37d, from frozen carcasses ( validation mice, b ). tissue lysates were analyzed for liver enzyme activities. spaceflight increased liver gsr and gapdh activity. activity levels also were not significantly different between gc and flt groups in validation mice."
942," rna integrity numbers ( rin ) were determined to assess rna quality as described in methods. rna was extracted from livers and spleens of experimental mice and validation mice that were dissected and preserved on - orbit ( or on the ground) Total rna analyzed by rtqpcr for expression of 12 liver - associated genes : hmgcr, cat, gsr, serpina1e, cdkn1a, chka, pnpla3, tef, snd1, nr4a1, nox4, and taf."
943," expression of gsr, cdkn1a, and chka were elevated in flt mice compared with gc mice. Tef expression was reduced as a result of spaceflight ( supplementary fig. s3 ). patterns of relative gene expression in samples recovered from frozen carcasses did not appear to be the same as those recovered from on orbit dissected tissues."
944,"The main objective of this work was to develop new capability for conducting long duration, rodent experiments in space which minimize the complications of non - specific, chronic stress responses. all animals were healthy throughout the duration of the mission as evidenced by daily video health checks. We found validation flt mice had similar body mass as a consequence of spaceflight when compared to gc and viv mice."
945,"Both the validation and experimental flt mice engaged in more active behaviors than their respective gc mice ( fig. 3, supplementary fig. s1 ). this finding was surprising but consistent with a recent report that simulated weightlessness ( 14d ) also leads to increased locomotion. despite previously reported atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle due to microgravity 12, 29, 30, 33, no difference in gastrocNemius mass was observed in validation flt vs. gc."
946,"Thymus glands and livers were significantly heavier in flt mice compared with gc mice ( fig. 5 ) whereas spleen weights did not differ. Unlike previous missions, tissues from mice analyzed in the present study were preserved on - orbit, and therefore the animals did not endure the added challenges of a return flight to earth."
947,"There have been no reports showing direct evidence that liver function is altered in astronauts during missions lasting up to one year. In validation mice, spaceflight increased activity levels of gsr and gapdh, relative to cage - matched gc. relevance of spaceflight - induced liver toxicity in rodents to human astronauts remains uncertain."
948," enzyme activities from livers of experimental flt mice were similar to those of samples prepared under optimal laboratory conditions. protocols for gc sample collection and storage that were specifically planned to duplicate on - orbit procedures, including dissection timing and preservation. rna from liver samples either freshly dissected or from carcasses, exhibited rin values that exceeded 6. 5 ( fig. 8c ) rna recovered from frozen spleens in preflight experiments consistently yielded rna with very low rinvalues ( results not shown )"
949,"Tissue responses which are most likely to be sensitive to the stress of launch. unique habitats and environmental control systems must be devised to adequately support both flt and gc animals. the system was intended to support long duration experiments, the effects of transient stressors associated with launch would diminish by the time of sample recovery."
950,"Study of the entire cycle of long duration space travel. although there are individual variabilities, similar phases of adaptation to spaceflight are seen in crew members. Study of the whole cycle of space travel, including the early stages of spaceflight. study of the first space shuttle flight, in the early 1960s."
951," melanin has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against uv radiation in other fungi. We found that 1, 8 - dihydroxynaphthalene ( dhn ) - melanin mutants of two clinical a. fumigatus strains but not an iss - isolated strain were more sensitive to uv - c than their respective wild - type ( wt ) strains."
952,"Dhn - melanin was found to be a virulence factor in cea17 and if1sw - f4 but not af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed uv - c - protective properties. Two other spore. metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no uv. c - Protective properties. taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across aspergillus isolates and by types of environmental stress."
953,A diet supplemented with dried plum powder ( dp ) prevented radiation - induced bone loss in mice. We show that the dp diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. A dietary supplementation with dp could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.
954,"There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss. radiation includes a mix of low - linear energy transfer ( let ) species such as protons and helium ions as well as high - let species like iron. beyond leo, for example, astronauts may be exposed to up to 0. 7 Sv of ionizing radiation during a multi - year mission to the moon or mars."
955,"Dried plum, prunus domestica l., has been shown to have beneficial effects against bone loss. The mechanism of action of dried plum is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that the high antioxidant capacity and high polyphenolic content of this fruit scavenges free - radicals as well as promotes bone formation."
956,"The hu model is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents. exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors 53, 54. There is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and ir cause additive or synergistic effects when combined 20, 44, 45."
957,"The dp diet had the capacity to protect osteoprogenitors after exposure to simulated microgravity, an essential part in the healthy maintenance of skeletal tissue. We analyzed both cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as mechanical Properties of Skeletal Tissue."
958,"Male c57bl / 6 j mice ( jackson labs, sacramento, ca ) at 14 weeks of age were weight matched, assigned to groups ( n = 10 / group ), and individually housed in standard vivarium cages or custom - designed hu cages as previously described 46. 14 week old mice were used to allow for a 2 week pre - feeding period. two weeks of prefeeding period was selected to provide sufficient time for animals to adapt to the diet prior to initiating exposure to simulated spaceflight."
959,"At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to 2 gy gamma of whole - body ir ( 137 cs at 0. 83 gy / min, jl shepherd mark i, san gabriel, ca ) as used in schreurs et al. 43. mice were housed individually in a custom animal holding cage, maintaining hu mice in a head- down position. sham - irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off. after 24 hours at 4 °c, samples were transferred to 70 % ethanol for long-term storage."
960,"A 0mm - thick region of cancellous bone located 0. 5 mm distal to the proximal growth plate of the tibia was selected and auto - contoured as detailed by buie et al. 74. An automated contouring program was used to select and measure the microarchitecture of the cortical shell surrounding the abovementioned cancellous region. cortical parameters of interest included periosteal ( peri. p, mm ) and endosteal. ( endo. p,. mm ) perimeters."

965,"Mice exposed to simulated spaceflight factors, alone or combined, and fed a dp diet did not exhibit significant deficits in cancellous microarchitecture of the tibia compared to nl control mice. In mice fed the cd diet, exposure to ir alone led to a 20 % decrease in percent bone volume ( bv / tv ) and a modest but statistically significant 7 % increase in trabecular separation ( tb. sp )"
966,"The skeletal decrements due to simulated spaceflight were observed in mice fed the dp diet. mice were fed either cd or dp and then were either unloaded to simulate weightlessness ( hu ), irradiated with 2 gy 137 cs ( ir ), or a combination of the two. tibiae were analyzed by microct for cancellous bone parameters such as bone volume fraction, thickness and trabecular number."
967,Cortical thickness at the proximal tibia was lower in mice exposed to hu ( −10 % ) and the combination of hu and ir ( −9 % ) compared to nl controls. No significant changes were observed in the cortical parameters measured at the distal tibia for mice fed either diet.

970,Mice fed the dp diet did not show any hu - induced decrements. exposure to ir did not result in any changes to the microarchitecture of the vertebrae. The maximum load for mice on the cd diet was 35 % and 36 % lower after exposure to hu and hu + ir.
971,Mice fed the cd diet had a significant decrease ( 49 % ) in colony counts. mice fed the dp diet did not sustain any decrease in their osteoblast colony formation despite exposure to hu. simulated weightlessness induced decrement in e x - vivo osteooblastogenesis was prevented by dp.

973,A diet supplemented with dp prevented most of the simulated spaceflight - induced damages to both the appendicular ( i. e. tibia ) and axial (i.e. vertebrae ) skeleton. mice fed the control diet and exposed solely to ir displayed a 20 % decrement in bv / tv and a 7 % increase in the tb. sp of the tibia ’ s cancellous region relative to the sham control.
974,"Mice fed the control diet were exposed to hu, either independently or in combination with ir. When mice were fed the dp diet, ir - induced cancellous bone loss was entirely prevented, consistent with the radio - protective results reported in our previous study 43. In the proximal tibia hu and ir together, not each treatment alone, caused a decrease in cortical thickness."
975,"Hu - induced damage to the vertebral body was entirely prevented when mice consumed the dp diet. There was a statistically significant increase in tt. bv / tv ( 9 %, fig. 4, panel a ) for sham - irradiated, nl mice fed dp."
976,"The ability of dried plum to protect osteoblast progenitor cells from hu - induced damage, as shown in this study, holds much promise for development of next generation anti - osteoporotic drugs. Since astronauts on long - term space missions may require a countermeasure for bone loss throughout the entirety of a multi - year mission beyond leo, it is important in future studies to determine if dp is protective for long -term exposure to simulated, or actual, spaceflight."
977,"Dried plum could be a countermeasure against both radiation - and microgravity - induced osteopenia such as loss of bone strength and structure in the tibia and vertebrae. Future studies are needed to determine if dp is protective for long - term exposure to simulated, or actual, spaceflight."
978,"The eden iss greenhouse is a space - analog test facility near the german neumayer station in antarctica. The purpose of the facility is to enable multidisciplinary research on topics related to future plant cultivation on human space exploration missions. research on food quality and safety, plant health monitoring, microbiology, system validation, human factors and horticultural sciences was conducted."
979,"Food production during human space missions to and on moon and mars is a necessary step to reduce resupply mass from earth and thus long - term mission costs. growing plants for food production also offers the advantages of producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. experiments in growing plants in space began as early as the first manned space stations and continue to the present day. the eden iss project is the newest space greenhouse analog project to test subsystems, technologies, operation procedures and plant cultivation for future space missions."

We show altered trafficking of pin2 precedes altered auxin transport and defects in gravitropism and lateral root development in this mutant upon transition to the restrictive temperature."
998,"The process of auxin transport drives many aspects of plant development, including primary root elongation, lateral root development, and asymmetric growth in response to gravity and light gradients. directionality is controlled by asymmetric localization of pin proteins at the plasma membrane. The polar distribution of the pin proteins is dynamic ( barbosa and schwechheimer, 2014 ; weller et al., 2017)"
999,"The scd1 protein has a denn domain, found exclusively in rab - gefs ( yoshimura et al., 2010 ; marat et al,. 2011 ). scd 1 and an associated protein, scd2, have been shown to complex with a rabe1 at the exocyst in arabidopsis roots ( mayers etal., 2017 ), where it plays a role in exocytosis and recycling of membrane proteins. This study utilizes the unique features of a temperature sensitive scdone - 1 mutant allele to demonstrate that the growth and developmental effects in arABIDopsis roots at the restrictive temperature are tied to altered auxin transport protein targeting."
1000,"At the restrictive temperature, pin2 fused to gFP accumulates in endomembrane vesicles in scd1 - 1. These results provide support for the hypothesis that scd 1 protein functions to regulate the movement of pin2. These transient changes in localization occur more rapidly than changes in auxin transport and dependent developmental processes."
1001," root growth and development of scd1 - 1 were compared to its parental line, columbia glabrous - 1 [ ( col ( g ) ] at 18°c and at 25°c. At 18°C, col (G) and scd 1 - 1 had similar primary root elongation rates and lateral root numbers. At 25°C primary roots were substantially shorter than col (g) and the number of lateral roots were dramatically reduced."
1002,"The temperature sensitive phenotype of the scd1 - 1 mutant allowed us to ask if shorter - term growth at 25°c could induce this lateral root phenotype. We also wanted to see if the impaired root development at this restrictive temperature could be rescued by transition back to the permissive temperature. col ( g ) and scd 1 - 1 seedlings were grown at constant 18°c, or constant 25 °C, or grown at 18°C and then transferred to 25°C after 2, 4, or 6 days ( figures 1d, e ). for all these treatments, the number of lateral roots was quantified on the 10th day after sowing."
1003,"We examined the gravity response in wild type and scd1 - 1 seedling roots. at 25°c and transferred to 18°c after 2, 4, and 6 days ( figure 1e ) to determine if the ability to form roots could be restored upon transition to the permissive temperature. there were significantly more lateral root primordia formed on scd 1 - 1. seedlings switched from 25 to 18 °C at days 2 and 4 than seedlings grown at a constant 25 °C or transitioned after 6 days. these two experiments indicate that there is a developmental window between 2 and 6. days in which scD1 function is required for lateral root formation."
1004,"Gravitropic response of scd1 - 1 was quantified in seedlings grown at 18°c and transferred to 25°c for 4 h or 8 h before being reoriented 90° relative to the gravity vector. curvature was measured 8 h after reorientation. a significant decrease in the growth rate was observed beginning at 5 h after transfer to 25 °C, consistent with the impaired symmetric and asymmetric elongation of roots at 25°C, but not 18 °C."
1005,"The scd1 - 1 mutant has reduced iaa transport at the restrictive temperature. rootward ia a transport, which is required for lateral root emergence, was measured using a pulse chase assay. at 18°c, rootward transport was equivalent in col ( g ) and scd 1 - 1 ( figure 3a ). at 25°c,. the length of the zone of transported iaA was reduced (figure 3b ) and a significant reduction in the total rootward. transport ( the sum of samples in figures 3a, b ) was evident in scd2 - type."
1006,"rootward iaa transport was determined for seedlings grown at constant 18 or 25°c or transitioned from 18 to 25°C for 6 h before assay. at 18°c, there was no significant difference between wild type and scd1 - 1 in the amount of ia a transported ( figure 3e ). at 25° c, wild type roots had a twofold greater shootward auxin transport compared to those grown at 18 °C."
1007,"Scd1 - 1 seedlings were grown at 18°c for 5 days then transferred to 25°c. The amount of shootward 3 h - iaa transport was determined. within 8 h of transfer there was a significant decrease in ia a transport compared to wild type, with a further decrease by 24 h ( figure 3f ). scd1-1 roots showed a significantly slower shootward progression of gFP signal than wild type. These results are consistent with impaired iaA transport from the root tip at the restrictive temperature leading to reduced growth."
1008,"Seedlings were grown at 18°c for 5 days then were reoriented 90°, and then imaged at 2 h intervals after staining with propidium iodide ( pi ) to reveal the boundaries of cells. At 18°C roots of both genotypes showed asymmetric auxin - induced gFP fluorescence signal with the gFP signal moving a greater distance from the tip back on the lower side of roots. At 25°c, the wild type seedlings showed this same asymmetric gfp fluorescence, also beginning at 4 h post - reorientation. However, in scd1 - 1 at 25°C, weak asymmetric dr5 - gfp Flu"
1009,"The effects of the scd1 - 1 mutation on root development, gravitropism, and iaa transport suggests altered targeting of auxin transport proteins. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of pin2pro : : pin2 - gFP ( pin2- gFP ) fusion protein was examined in wild type and scd 1 - 1 seedlings. wild type seedlings grown at 18 and 25°c, and scD1 -1 seedlings grew at 18°c displayed a typical asymmetric plasma membrane localization of pin1pro."
1010," pin1 localizes to the rootward surface of cells in the root vascular cylinder ( galweiler et al., 1998 ). the pin1pro : : pin1 - gFP ( pin1- gFP ) was also found in endomembrane bodies in scd1 - 1 mutants at 25°c, but not in wild type. pin3pro :: pin3 - gfp ( pin3- gfp ) was not detected in endmembranes bodies. the localization of abcb19 and aux1 fused to fluorescent proteins was not altered in scD1 -1 ( figure 6 ). these data suggest that without fully functional scd 1 protein, the membrane"
1011,"We used the endocytic tracer fm4 - 64 ( bolte et al., 2004 ) to determine whether the pin2 - containing endomembrane bodies in scd1 - 1 at 25°c were endosomes. root tips were incubated in fm 4 - 64 for 20 min and co - localization of the fluorescent signals was quantified over time. A threshold function was applied to individual channels to quantify co- localization."
1012,"Fm4 - 64 and pin2 - gFP accumulation was observed over time in root tips of scd1 - 1 seedlings grown at 18°c for 7 days. Root tips were stained in fm4- 64 for 20 min, transferred to water, and imaged immediately ( 20 min ) or at later times as indicated. colocalization is indicated in the overlay as white."
1013,"Ara6 and ara7 are rab5 gtpase homologs, found in recycling endosomes ( ara6 ) or in late endosome, prevacuolar compartments and the trans golgi network (ara7) When scd1 - 1 seedlings expressing pin2 - gFP ( green ) and rfp - aa7 ( magenta ) were grown at 25°c, endomembrane bodies were observed that have only pin2-gFP signal or rfp-aa7 signal. The presence of both signals is consistent with other cargo proteins that move through ara-positive endoso."
1014, pin2 overlays ara7 and ara6 in endomembrane bodies found in the root tips of scd1 - 1 mutants at 25°c. The presence of both rfp - aa7 or aa6 - rfp and pin2 - gFP in a subset of these vesicles is consistent with other cargo proteins that move through ara 7 - positive endosomes.
1015,"These results are consistent with pin2 - gFP in scd1 - 1 accumulating in late multivesicular endosomes and not in other compartments. These results are also consistent with tgn ( syp61 - cfp ) ( robert et al., 2008 ) or the sorting endosome ( snx1 - rFP ) ( jaillais et al,. 2006, 2007 ; supplementary figure s5 )."
1016,Polar transport of the hormone auxin from cell to cell is controlled by the asymmetric localization of the pin family of iaa efflux carriers. internal and external environmental cues also affect the localization of pin proteins through regulation of the flow of pins between the endosome and plasma membrane. scd1 contains a denn domain found in proteins with rab - directed gef activity and in proteins that interact with clathrin. The effects of the temperature - sensitive scd 1 - 1 mutant on root development was examined at the permissive and restrictive temperatures of 18 and 25°c.
1017,The ability to reversibly manipulate lateral root development in the scd1 - 1 mutant provided unique insight into how this process is regulated. A temperature - switch assay was performed resulting in the shift of seedlings from the permissive temperature to the non-permissive temperature or vice versa over 10 days. We found that both shootward and rootward transport are impaired at the restrictive temperature. These data support the hypothesis that scd 1 is needed for lateral rootdevelopment between days 2 and 6.
1018," pin2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism. pin2 is normally localized to the plasma membrane on the shootward end of cells of the lateral root cap and epidermis of the developing root of wild type seedlings. in the scd1 - 1 mutant, pin2 - gFP was not restricted to the Plasma membrane but was also localized in endomembrane bodies. since changes in auxin. transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8 – 12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential."
1019, pin2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism. pin2 - gFP endomembrane accumulation is evident with less than hour. in col ( g ) a transition from 18 to 25°c increases shootward transport by more than fivefold within 5 h. treatment of roots for 12 h at the non - permissive temperature impaired gravity response in scd1 - 1 to levels consistent with constitutive growth.
1020," pin2 has previously been localized to ara7 vesicles in arabidopsis roots after treatment with endosidin 16, which inhibits apical membrane trafficking ( li et al., 2017 ). The colocalization of pin2 with both aa7 and ara6 rab - related gtpases is not surprising considering that compartments bearing ara 7 and aa6 have been previously shown to partially overlap."
1021,"The pvc, where both ara6 and ara7 are found, is a distinct organelle in plants. plasma membrane proteins that pass through the pvc have been shown to be directed to the vacuole for degradation. pin1, pin2, and aux1 are targeted to the Vacuole through the multi - vesicular body ( mvb) pin protein turnover involves cycling between the endosome and plasma membrane."
1022,"A mutant with a defect in a gene that functions as a rab - gef has altered localization of pin2, with accumulation of this protein in endomembrane bodies. polar auxin transport and gravity response are impaired in scd1 - 1. These findings provide direct evidence that disruption of the targeting machinery which disrupts pin2 protein localization precedes reductions in Auxin transport."
1023,"We flew nasa ’ s c - 20a aircraft on two consecutive days in june 2018 along identical flight paths over the us sierra nevada mountain range. bioaerosols were analyzed by metagenomic dna sequencing and traditional culturing methods.

Other known effects on aerosol lifetimes in the atmosphere, including highly convective conditions and additional emissions from the earth ’ s surface were not considered."
1033,"About 10 m reads were obtained for each flight sample. after lmat analysis, which combines forward and reverse reads into a single unit, an average of 5 m reads per sample were uniquely assigned to a taxonomic identifier at the given score threshold 14, 15. on average, 940, 000 reads per Sample corresponded to microbial sequences, out of which 613, 000 Reads were assigned at the genus level."
1034,"No significant differences between samples were observed using a kruskall - wallis one - way anova of species richness, nor shannon and simpson indices. Further pairwise comparisons of ground, 10, 000 ft and 30,000 ft groups using the mann – whitney and student ’ s t - tests found no significant difference between the groups either."

At 40,000 ft, top five taxa were dominated by a single genus ( e. g., alcaligenes 97 % on May 20, and penicillium 82% on May 21). The altitude where the taxonomy composition was most similar between the two days sampled was 30, 000ft where both delftia and strept"
1037,"Bacillus was the most prevalent genus identified, measured in 25 % of flight samples and all control samples. streptococcus and streptomyces were also identified from a 40,000 ft sample. other bacteria found in controls were lysinibacillus sinduriensis and methylorubrum zatmanii."

1041,"The study was based on a shotgun metagenomics approach analyzing samples acquired between 10, 000 to 40, 000 ft, on two consecutive summer days over the us sierra nevada mountain ranges. The most abundant taxa identified in the flight samples were : achromobacter, alcaligenes, delftia, lachnoanaerobaculum, mycobacterium, penicillium, prevotella, pseudoperonospora, stenotrophomonas, streptococcus, tetrahymena, and veillonella. wastewater treatment facilities could be a contributing source of these bioaerosols."
1042,"Mycobacterium was among the most abundant genera at 10,000 ft on the first sampling day. wastewater treatment facilities could be a contributing source of these bioaerosols. achromobacter xylosoxidans may be the most clinically relevant species detected in our study."
1043,Viable bacteria measured in our study included some endospore formers resistant to extremes and frequently reported in other high altitude surveys. The long - range dispersal of viable bioaerosols may be critical to understanding agricultural and public health implications because the troposphere and lower stratosphere can enable microbial dispersal over geographic barriers.
1044,"The atmospheric microbiome was dynamically changing at each altitude. lachnoanaerobaculum, alcaligenes, mycobacterium, tetrahymena, and veillonella were abundant on the first day, while penicillium, prevotella, pseudoperonospora, and porphyromononas were only enriched on the second day. Another unexpected dna signal was pinus ( second flight day at 10, 000 ft ), suggesting the sampled air mass had recently passed over forested terrain."
1045,"Most previous vertical aerobiology studies relied upon 16s rrna amplicon methods, which targets and pcr - amplifies short regions of the 16s gene.

1050,"Nucleolin stress - related gene nuc2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc 2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. ground control findings will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments."
1051,"Plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator tor kinase. in addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development."
1052,"Red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. Light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation ( silva - navas et al., 2016 ). This reduction could be related to the sugar starvation that results from the inability to perform photosynthesis. The absence of gravity ( weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free - fall, or in spaceflight ) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants."
1053, phytochrome mutants ( phya and phyb ) known to be involved in phototropism were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days. Analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth.
1054,"Nucleolin is the most abundant protein of the nucleolus, where it plays a key role in the different steps involved in ribosome biogenesis. animal and yeast genomes encode a single nucleolin gene, whereas plants offer various examples of gene multiplicity. in a. thaliana, two genes encoding nucleolin proteins have been described. disruption of nuc1 gene leads to severe defects in plant growth and development."
1055, knockout of the nuc2 gene induces expression of some rdna variants and hypermethylation of some sequences of pre - rrna. disruption of nuc1 - 2 gene has much weaker effects. The results may lead to more efficient agriculture if an exaggerated response may reduce plant development under suboptimal conditions.

1057,"Seedlings were germinated in the same spaceflight hardware during 4 days with a day / night cycle of illumination. Half of the samples were exposed to 2 days of darkness and the other group to two days of continuous red light. After 6 days growth in the culture chamber ( cc ), the experiment was completed and the phenotypes of the three mutants were observed. seedling growth was homogeneous within each cassette, with clearly smaller seedlings in the case of the nuc1 - 2 mutant."
1058,"We compared seedlings with the differential illumination during the last 2 days of the plant growth period for each of the lines used ( wt, nuc1 - 2, and nuc2 - 2 ). the number of differentially expressed genes ( degs ) in the wt is 1, 428 genes, of which 1, 067 have their expression activated and 361 have it repressed. in the nuc 1 - 2 mutant, the total number of degs is lower ( 1, 001 ), mainly at the expense of the up - regulated genes ( 633 are over - expressed and 368 are repressed ). the effect is clearer in the dark samples, because the red light stimulation"
1059,"The number of degs from the comparison ( red light versus darkness ) in the nuc2 - 2 mutant is very similar as in the wt. red light up - regulated genes affected only 298 genes in the Wt, 134 genes in nuc1 - 2 and 199 genes for nuc 2 - 2. among degs down - regulated by the red light compared with the dark, there is a similar number of unique degs for each of them."
1060,"The nuc1 - 2 genotype is the only one lacking an increased secondary metabolism, together with a response to stress elements ( cold ) observed in both wt and nuc2 - 2. red light photostimulation versus darkness mainly leads to an unequivocal activation of genes involved in different phases of photosynthesis in all three a. thaliana lines examined."
1061,"Red light photostimulation reduces expression of genes involved in the response to different stimuli ( temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress ) as well as the circadian rhythm of plants. dissecting transcriptional status for each genotype for illumination conditions at normal earth gravity to better understand the differences."
1062,"The number of degs between the wt and nuc2 - 2 mild mutant peaked to 225 when red light photostimulation was provided. Most functional categories ( go terms ) appearing up - regulated in the nuc1 - 2 mutant are related to the cell wall ( cell wall macromolecule catabolic process, pectin biosynthetic process)"
1063,"The up - regulated processes when red light is applied are quite different. degs appeared involved in cell wall ( structural constituents of cell wall ) and in development ( positive regulation of growth, post - embryonic plant morphogenesis, cellular response to ethylene stimulus ). In the nuc1 - 2 versus nuc2 - 2 comparison, many genes with a red light - activated expression were involved in ribosome biogenesis."
1064," genes involved in long - day photoperiodism, flowering, rhythmic process, and response to light intensity were also less represented. cellular responses to light stimulus category was over - represented in both nucleolin mutants with respect to wt. gene categories repressed only in the nuc1 - 2 versus nuc2 - 2 comparison were involved in the spliceosome, protein demethylation, chromatin organization, mrna binding, and histone acetyltransferase activity."
1065,"The networks show that processes such as cell cycle ( left part or up - regulated genes ), circadian rhythms, and stress responses are already affected in the 1× g control conditions as a reference for the seedling growth spaceflight experiments. gene in each node is represented by a chart indicating the functional category to which each one belongs ( following the color legend )."
1066,Spaceflight experiments can have several limitations that are not often present in other biological - omics works. A specific constraint for plant space biology is the limited number of different mutants / genotypes that can be used in a spaceflight experiment in true microgravity. The use of nucleolin mutants is a promising choice to provide insight into cell cycle and stress response mechanisms.
1067,"Red light illumination mainly produces the activation of genes involved in photosynthesis, cell wall modification, drug catabolism, pathogenesis, and biotic stress response. Different abiotic stimuli responses ( temperature, hypoxia, light, abscisic acid, oxidative stress ) are down - regulated by the photostimulation treatment, as well as the circadian rhythm of plants. gravitational stress could be counteracted by changing phototropic stimuli."
1068,"In a stress condition such as darkness, the nuc2 protein is capable of rescuing functions that nuc1 protein performs under normal growth conditions. differential role of nucleolin mutants ' transcriptomic baseline may offer new insight in spaceflight experiments. differential transcriptional response is observed when comparing the two nucleolin mutant."
1069,"Nucleolin mutant lines, compared with wt, have genes up - regulated by red light involved in different response processes, such as the response to hypoxia, drug, antibiotic, salicylic acid, and wounding. These response processes are extended in the nuc2 - 2 versus wt comparison, including response to cold, bacteria, and abscisic acid."
1070,"Nuc2 protein can replace the essential functions of nuc1 in orbit, and how light can modulate it. Cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis functions required to be restored in microgravity are also light dependent. We anticipate confirming that the duplicated nucleolin gene system works during spaceflight will lead us to discover novel mechanisms for plant adaptation."
1071,"The space environment presents stressors that include radiation, microgravity, and isolation. understanding how these factors affect biology is crucial for safe and effective crewed space exploration. we have formed an international consortium of scientists who aim to develop better standardization guidelines of space biology ( especially omics ) data."

1073,"The response to heat in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°c and dehydrated fronds up to 65°c for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem ( ps ) ii efficiency, and metabolic indicators."
1074," introduction heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity. Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, atp synthesis and variable ( f v ), and maximum ( f m ) chlorophyll fluorescence. heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase ( sod) and catalase ( cat)"
1075,Studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress. This approach obscures the individual stress response. separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions. plants that are especially well - suited to study desiccence stress are “ resurrection ” plants.
1076,"We studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern pleopletis polypodioides in dry and hydrated fronds. In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed. The folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation. independent of hydration, oxidative and antioxidants are sensitive to heat."
1077,"Dried tissue showed no effects, but discolorations became visible after rehydration. exposure to 55°c resulted in patchy browning along the mid - rib ( rachis ) of the frond ( figure 2d ) ; after 60°c fronds were slightly discolored and after 65°c completely discoloured. submersed and partly submered fronds showed no effect at 30°c but after exposure > 40°c submerses showed browning."
1078,"The chlorophyll fluorescence ( f t ) of pleopeltis fronds increased over time and reached control levels within 5 h for temperatures up to 35°c. exposure to higher temperatures ( ≤55°c ) required a recovery period of 24 h. despite the high f t values, the q y decreased with higher temperatures. beyond 45°c, q y efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature."
1079,"F t of partially submersed fronds decreased after exposure to temperatures higher than 40°c. beyond 45°c, q y efficiency decreased steadily with increasing temperature. after recovery ( at room temperature for 24 h ), f t and q y of 30 and 35°c treated samples did not differ from controls. in 40°C treated samples q y remained significantly lower than base - line values. unchanging but measurable f t values in ≥ 45°C fronds indicates degradation of ps ii."
1080, electrolyte leakage measured as conductivity of external water after 24 h at various temperatures. elemental analysis of the leachate revealed that k + is the major released ion followed by ca + 2 and s. na + and mg 2 + were present at lower quantities. dried fronds showed significantly lower activity than hydrated tissue.
1081,Dried fronds showed significantly lower activity than hydrated tissue below 45°c but their reducing capacity exceeded that of submersed tissue at higher temperatures. fully and partly submerged fronds responded similarly and showed their highest values at 35°c ( figure 7 ). higher temperatures led to a decrease on peroxides that was less in dried than in submered fronds.
1082,"Dried fronds showed a steady increase with temperature with a maximum at 40°c. partly and fully submersed samples reached their maximum at 35°c but showed lower levels of looh than dried fronds at 45 and 50°c ( figure 8 ), likely related to damaged metabolism, which weakens the response. The maximum looh values signal the onset of non - compensated, i. e., damaging, heat stress."
1083,"Glutathione ( gsh) consumption responded stronger to desiccation than heat stress. consumption in dried fronds decreased at 45°c compared to 30 – 40°c treated samples. The extent of submersion had no effect. The total fa content in dehydrated fronds increased up to 35°c but decreased at higher temperatures. In partly and fully submersed fronds, the total fatty acid reached its peak at 30°c."
1084," linolenic acid ( 18 : 3 ) was the dominant fa at all temperatures. The percentage of unsaturated fatty acids in 30°c, dried and partly submersed samples was 12 and 5 % lower than at 25°c. exposure to temperatures higher than 30°C decreased unsaturation. regardless of the hydration condition, after exposure to temperature of 45°c and higher, all fas showed reduced but equal quantities."
1085,"Our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. because of the reduced metabolism under dry conditions, it is likely that dry tissue shows reduced susceptibility to heat damage."
1086,"Pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall ( willats et al., 2001 ) and heat sensitivity. loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation. fronds exposed to 30 – 50°c fully expanded upon rehydration ( at 25°c ) and did not show necrosis."
1087,"Based on browning, our morphological data indicate that 40°c is the threshold for heat damage for hydrated pleopeltis fronds. In contrast, dried fronds can tolerate > 60°c ( figure 2 ). photosynthetic susceptibility dried frond fluorescence ( f t ) and quantum yield ( q y ) of dried frondo were lower than in fresh fronds but readily detectable. after dry fronds were exposed to > 50°c, q y was undetectable and f t decreased."
1088," fronds re - hydrated after 60°c appeared photosynthetically functional but at significantly reduced efficiency. photosynthetic activity ( q y ) in re- hydrated fronds after 65°c was not detectable. heat exerts long - term stress on the ps ii system, likely by interfering with water oxidation complex."
1089," electrolyte leakage an increase in conductivity of the external medium indicates cell membrane damage and efflux of ions ( ilik et al., 2018 ). high conductivity in fully submersed samples relative to partly submersing suggests that the integrity of the membrane is affected by the combination of heat and extent of immersion. absence of gas exchange seems to negatively impact membrane stability, especially at temperatures > 35°c."
1090,Photosynthetic data and cation leakage suggest that thermal tolerance of hydrated fronds is 40°c. metabolism metabolically active cells rely on a steady supply of reduced compounds. assessing the metabolic status of dried pleopeltis through aqueous redox dyes is problematic because tissue rehydrates.
1091," exposure of plants to heat leads to senescence, necrotic symptoms, or apoptosis. pleopeltis, like most plants, responds to heat by enhanced production of ros. ros activate signal transduction and ultimately defense mechanisms and pcd ( burbridge et al., 2006 ). decrease of hydroperoxide ( figure 7 ) above 40°c indicates damaging shifts in the redox equilibrium."
1092," cat, an important enzyme for the detoxification of h 2 o 2, is sensitive to elevated temperatures. The decreased availability of antioxidants or activity of reducing enzymes likely enhances ros toxicity. The accumulation of the oxidized form of gsh ( gssg ) in chloroplasts and vacuoles is important for redox regulation."
1093,"The fa composition of pleopeltis fronds changes with temperature and hydration. increasing temperature reduces desaturation and overall fa quantity, which indicates that heat interferes with either fatty acid synthesis and / or stimulates fatty acid breakdown. saturated fas reduce membrane fluidity and enhance integrity. both parameters are important for surviving high temperatures."
1094," fa profiling can be an effective stress indicator. future studies will decipher how the fa profile changes with the extent and duration of stress, and during recovery. dried material undergoes metabolic reactions of lipids and longevity has been attributed to “ differences in the structure or mobility of molecules within the solidified cytoplasm ”"
1095,Dried fronds recovered after exposure up to 55°c while thermo - tolerance of hydrated fronds was limited to 40°c. The difference in heat tolerance between hydrated and dried fronds indicates that dehydration protects pleopeltis from heat damage. Our data further illustrate the adaptability of this epiphytic fern to cope with environmental stress.
1096,"Microgravity causes heart dysfunction in a fly cardiac model. hearts are less contractile and exhibit changes in genes and proteins that maintain heart structure and function. effects are seen in several lines of flies, suggesting a common response to microgravity. understanding the effects of microgravity on human organs is crucial to exploration of low - earth orbit and the moon."
1097,Several fungal and bacterial samples were launched in september 2019 on a large nasa scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere ( km altitude ) where radiation levels resembled values at the equatorial mars surface. spores from the fungus a. niger and cells from the gram - ( – ) bacterium s. shabanensis were the most resistant with a 2 - and 4 - log reduction. exposed buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9 was completely inactivated.
1098," introduction mariner iv was the first successful robotic mission to mars producing surface photos and preliminary data used to model atmospheric pressure, layer heights, and temperature. in the half century since that first pioneering mission, orbital and surface rover missions have continued to characterize the mars environment. understanding microbial adaptations to either isolated and combined extreme environmental stressors helps ( i) establish the limits of life on earth as we know it."
1099,"In the middle stratosphere during daytime hours, the following mars - like factors are simultaneously present : intense, full spectrum ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation, high energy ionizing radiation ( including secondary scattering ), desiccation, hypoxia, and ultralow temperatures and pressures. taken together, these combined conditions cannot be found naturally anywhere on the surface of the earth and would be challenging to easily reproduce in laboratory - based experiments. reaching the middle Stratosphere is relatively achievable compared to suborbital and orbital spaceflight investigations."
1100,"Four microorganisms relevant to astrobiology and space biology were flown inside the microbes in atmosphere for radiation, survival, and biological outcomes experiment ( marsbox ) payload. The two bacterial extremophiles, salinisphaera shabanensis and buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9, were included to test the hypothesis that terrestrial microbial strains, isolated from extreme mars - analog environments, can withstand the stress factors of a martian - like environment."
1101,Marsbox is the most robust mars analog. from the first marsbox mission. It was launched in 2009 and is currently on its second mission. The mission is scheduled to return to Earth in 2018. It is the first mission to orbit the Earth since the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.
1102,"This study exposed different microorganisms ( aspergillus niger, staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, salinisphaera shabanensis, and buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9 ) to a mars analog environment. The robust simulation of mars environmental conditions was made possible with access to earth ’ s middle stratosphere onboard a scientific balloon flight."
1103,"M - 42 ionizing radiation data in the following sub - section, we will only provide a snapshot of the data measured with the m - 42 instrument. in figure 5, we provide the count rate of the silicon diode for the whole time the system was powered. at cruising altitude, we saw a nearly constant count rate which results in a dose rate of 75. 5 ± 13 μgy per day. in total we measured a dose of 20. 9 μgy for the entire mission, equivalent to around 10 days of natural background radiation received in the dlr laboratory in cologne."
1104,"Survival fraction ( n / n0) of tested strains after exposure to mars simulated conditions aboard the marsbox payload. survival and metabolic activity of staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis for s. shabanensis. buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9 showed no growth, even in the laboratory controls."
1105,Aspergillus niger spores were the most resistant to all tested conditions. Salinisphaera shabanensis was able to endure 5 months of desiccation. With resazurin assay no metabolic activity was detected for buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9.
1106,"Survival, germination, and metabolic activity were compared between spore monolayer and spore multilayer. in uv - shielded martian - like conditions, the presence of a multilayers was shown to significantly decrease survival ( p = 0. 01 ) and germination rate ( p < 0. 004 ) ( figure 8 ) but to significantly increase metabolic activity ( p > 0. 02) ( figure 7). In uv- exposed, mars - like. conditions, a. niger spores were significantly faster in reaching the metabolic maximum than monolayers spores, in all tested conditions ( table 4)."

The tested microorganisms ( aspergillus niger, staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, salinisphaera shabanensis, and buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9 ) were chosen based on astrobiology and space biology relevance."
1109,"A. niger spores may cause respiratory diseases, especially when in closed indoor habitats such as the iss. This motivates further study on how the species responds to spaceflight conditions, and consequent implications for astronaut health. The staphylococcus capitis subsp. k1 -2 - 2 - 23 ( dsm 111179 ) used in this study was isolated aboard the iss within an indoor exposure experiment."
1110,We measured ionizing radiation in the middle stratosphere with the m - 42 active dosimeter. This was the first successful flight test in preparation for the dosimetry suite onboard the upcoming matroshka astrorad radiation experiment on the nasa artemis i mission. A more comprehensive radiation biophysics analysis will be reported later alongside additional balloon flight measurements from a joint nasa - dlr long - duration antarctic mission flown in december 2019.
1111,"Bacterium s. shabanensis, and the human skin associated bacterium. s. capitis survived the uv - shielded mars - like environment during the balloon flight. Results suggest that bacterial bioburden embedded deep inside of spacecraft sent to mars might remain viable for longer periods of time ( > 5 h)"
1112,"Bacterial species s. shabanensis showed survival under long - term desiccation and sunlight exposed flight conditions. cells of s. capitis subsp. capsitis k1 - 2 - 2-2 - 23 were inactivated from the flight uv - exposure but did partially survive the uv- shielded layer of the trex - box. The last bacterial species flown in this experiment, buttiauxella sp. mase - im - 9, did not survive long -term desicitation."
1113,"A. niger spores survive mars - like conditions while bacterial cells were sensitive to uv exposure in the middle stratosphere. The spores of the aspergillus genus might be associated with uv protection roles ( blachowicz et al., 2020 ). The ubiquitous presense of a. n Niger spores in human indoor - closed habitats might be linked to their protection from uv radiation."
1114,"The ubiquitous presense of a. niger spores in human indoor - closed habitats, and their high resistance to outer space conditions, suggests these will likely travel with us to mars. A. - melanin ( a pigment ) and fumiquinazoline might be associated with uv protection roles ( blachowicz et al., 2020 )."

1116,"A variety of terrestrial analogs and simulation chambers have been used to predict outcomes for microbial exposure to mars - like conditions. The renewed focus on mars robotic and human exploration e. g., mars 2020, mars sample return ( nasa, 2020 ) and exomars 2022 ( esa, 2020) amplifies the need for additional mars analog studies in the coming years."
1117,"Fungal spore sensitivity to extreme heat or to high doses of combined sources of space radiation, as well as to other factors that affect survivability ( e. g., regolith reactive compounds or regolith shielding ), should be further evaluated to better assess the forward contamination potential in mars analog environments."

1124,"There are three distinct steps to the rcp, the first of which is data preprocessing. The pipeline begins with quality control ( qc ) of raw fastq files from a short - read illumina sequencer using the fastqc software ( andrews, 2010 ) The pipeline then uses trimgalore to remove sequencing adapters and low - quality bases that would disrupt read mapping. trimmed reads are then used as input data for fastqC followed by multiqc to generate trimmed read quality metrics."
1125,"Trimmed reads are first aligned to the reference genome with star, a splice - aware aligner ( dobin et al., 2013 ). star must be run in two steps. the first step is to create indexed genome files to assist read mapping. the second step of star mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome."
1126,"Star mapping output data are in binary alignment map ( bam ) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference. reads are then re - mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms ( dobin et al., 2013 ). users are provided with these results for further analysis of differential splicing."
1127,The data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. a list of the reference genomes used in the genelab pipeline is available in table s2. isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the rcp.
1128,"The star aligner consistently performs better than or on par with the tools tested for the indicated criteria. The r program deseq2 is run in order to determine which genes are differentially expressed between experimental conditions using gene count files from rsem. Once reads have been mapped and quantified, differential expression analysis is performed using the Deseq2 r package."
1129,"The genelab dge r script requires three inputs : the quantified count data from the previous ( rsem ) step; sample metadata from the investigation, study, and assay ( isa ) tables in the isa. zip file; and the organisms. csv file ( table s3 ), which is used to specify the organism used in the study and relevant gene annotations to load. because samples from somegenelab rna - seq datasets contain ercc spike - in and others do not, there are two versions of the dge. r script."
1130,"After metadata formatting, the rsem gene count data files from each sample are listed and re - ordered. These files are then imported with the r package, tximport ( soneson et al., 2015 ), and sample names are assigned. A deseqdataset object is then created using the formatted metadata and the count data that was imported with tximport. These filtered data are then prepared for normalization and dge analysis with deseq2."
1131,"For deseq2 analysis with ercc - normalization ( data s2 ), the size factor object of the non - ercc data is replaced with group b ercc size factors for re - scaling in the first Deseq2 step. group bErcc genes contain the same concentration in both mix1 and mix 2. only group b Ercc genes are used for generating the size factors. after normalization, the likelihood ratio test design is applied to the normalized data to generate the f statistic."
1132,"The r script reads the organisms. csv file to indicate the bioconductor annotationdata package needed. the current gene annotation database for the organism specified at the beginning of the r script is then loaded. dge tables containing normalized counts for each sample, pairwise dge results, and current gene annotations as well as computer - readable dge Tables are created."
1133," normalized count data for each gene across all samples, and for samples within each respective group, are calculated and added as columns to the dge output tables. a column containing the f statistic p value, calculated previously, is also added. principal component analysis ( pca ) is also performed on the normalized countData and used to create pca plots for the genelab data visualization portal."
1134,At1g01030 asu1 encodes a dicer homolog … nm _ 001197952 839574 3702. 2 na truncated version of the differential _ expression. csv file provided as genelab processed data for glds - 251. First 7 columns of the output table contain gene ids and annotations.
1135," downstream analyses were performed using processed data from select samples from rnaseq datasets hosted on genelab. These datasets met a specific set of criteria to be considered for downstream analysis. To showcase the value of using a consensus pipeline and publishing the processed data, we published the data from each step of the pipeline."
1136,"Only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples. Only studies that used the same preservation protocol ( liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post - mission ) and library preparation method ( ribo - depletion ), and samples that contained ercc spike - in to evaluate outputs with and without ercc normalization. select samples from two genelab datasets."
1137,"Only the later ( iss - terminal ) set of flt and respective gc samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the glds - 245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples. these results can then be further evaluated to identify similarities and differences in gene expression between these two studies and draw novel conclusions about the effects of spaceflight."
1138," heatmaps were generated using data in the differential expression tables for each respective dataset on the nasa genelab data repository. all samples included were derived from frozen carcasses post - mission and utilized the ribo - depletion library preparation method. for go terms, the number on the left corresponds to go terms enriched in flt samples. for gc samples, the numbers on the right correspond to go term enriched in gC samples."
1139,"The differentially expressed genes calculated by the rcp can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher - order analysis. tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and / or metabolite networks. popular software tools among the genelab working group members include webgestalt, string, gsea, piano and toppfun."
1140,"At least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for deseq2, to perform its statistical methods. More advanced rcp users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. There are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation."
1141,"Long - reads are typically used for dna sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the iss using ont for de novo assembly of the escherichia coli genome from raw reads. Long - reads offer some advantages for rna - seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in dge."
1142,All software packages are open source and are linked in the methods section. add functionality to process unique molecular identifiers ( umis ) that can identify pcr duplicates using tools such as umi tools. Transcriptomic data will be integrated with proteomic and metabolomics data. This will help further understand the significance of gene expression changes to metabolic “ fitness ” in the spaceflight environment.
1143," whole - genome sequences were generated from 96 bacterial strains of 14 species that were isolated from international space station surfaces during the microbial tracking 2 study. characterization of this closed habitat ' s microbiome enables tracking of the spread and evolution of secondary pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health."
1144,"Plants possess a systemic signaling system whereby local stimuli can lead to rapid, plant - wide responses. These changes trigger responses ranging from the production of hormones, to changes in the levels of primary metabolites and shifts in patterns of gene expression. Researchers are now beginning to uncover the molecular machineries behind this rapid communications network."
1145,"Using a ground - based model to simulate spaceflight [ 21 - days of single - housed, hindlimb unloading ( hlu ) combined with continuous low - dose gamma irradiation ( ldr, total dose of 0. 04 gy ) ] an in - depth survey of the immune and hematological systems of mice at 7 - days post - exposure was performed. Although immune differentials were not changed, deg analysis of the spleen revealed expression profiles associated with inflammation and dysregulated immune function."
1146,Readaptation to nominal gravitational environments is also an important factor in astronaut health. this is particularly important for future exploratory missions to the moon ( 0. 166 g ) or mars (0. 38 g ) involving long - duration exposures to microgravity and elevated doses of ionizing irradiation. understanding how immune and hematological cells compensate in response to the changing gravitational environment becomes particularly important.
1147,"Ground - based models of spaceflight are developed to easily explore the impacts of the spaceflight environment on physiology. here, we expand on this work, using rna - sequencing of splenic tissues and complete blood cell ( cbc ) counts to characterize relevant immune and hematological pathways engaged after 1 - week readaptation following simulated spaceflight conditions."
1148,"Six-month-old, female c57bl / 6j mice ( jackson laboratory) were acclimatized in standard habitats at 20 °c with a 12 h : 12 h light : dark cycle for 7 days. animals were housed one per cage and assigned to one of four groups : ( 1 ) control ( n = 6 ) ; ( 2 ) hindlimb unloaded ( hlu) ; ( 3 ) low - dose irradiated ( ldr, total dose 0. 04 gy ) ; and ( 4 ) simspace. after 7 - day post - simspace, mice were co 2 euthanized and spleens were collected and frozen. rna was isolated from"
1149," whole blood was collected via cardiac punch in [ k2 ] - ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) coated syringes immediately following euthanasia. parameters characterized include red blood cell ( rbc ), platelet ( plt ), and white blood cells ( wbc ) counts. mean corpuscular volume ( mcv, mean volume per rbc ) and mean hemoglobin concentration ( hgb) were also reported."
1150,"Libraries were amplified by pcr ( 17 cycles ) on a mastercycler pro ( eppendorf ) and purified with rnaclean xp agencourt beads ( beckman coulter, pasadena, ca, usa ). libraries were sequenced on a hiseq 4000 ( illumina, mira loma, ca,. usa ) to generate 15 – 30 m 75 - bp single end reads per sample. murine spleen deg that were orthologous to human blood gene - related diseases were identified using the network analyst global enrichnetwork tool."
1151,"The blood gene - related gene list was mapped to determine common pathways. differential expression analysis was performed in r deseq2. all groups were compared using the wald test and the likelihood ratio test. a one - way anova with post - hoc ( sidak ) test was performed for the calculated coefficient of gene expression variation per gene. an unpaired, parametric t test with welch ’ s correction was performed."
1152,Seven - days post - simulated spaceflight conditions result in distinct gene expression profiles. Principal component analysis ( pca ) plots were generated with each cohort. venn diagrams for downregulated ( b ) and upregulated ( c ) genes. calculated coefficient of gene expression variation ( cv ) per gene plotted against log 2 of the mean normalized count for that gene ( + 1 ) in each group.
1153,"7 - days post - simulated spaceflight conditions resulted in dysregulated immune and hematological system. blood cell types include, cd19, h2 - dmb2, alox5, and rhd ( fig. 2 b ). the proportion of upregulated : downregulated deg is approximately three : one."
1154," splenic degs are altered post - simulated spaceflight, with minimal differences in immune population distributions in circulating blood. There were significantly different deg between controls and post - simspace cohorts with functional associations to leukocyte subtype. There was no significant differences in population distributions."
1155," murine spleen deg that were orthologous to human blood disease / disorders markers, as defined by genecards human gene database and malacards human disease databases, were identified. using the network analyst global enrichnetwork tool, blood disease and disorder markers were mapped to determine common pathways. the results showed three genes bcl11a, nedd4l, and aspn had common pathways involved in regulation of blood pressure, protein modifications, transforming growth factor - β signaling, anatomical structure regulation, and negative regulation of developmental processes."
1156,"Human orthologs to mouse deg. cell numbers were normalized to controls. data represents ± sem, n = 6 per group. an unpaired, parametric t test with welch ’ s correction was performed for ( a – g ), * p < 0. 05."
1157,"Systems biology approach was applied to assess the effects of the immune and hematological outcomes post - simulated spaceflight. ground - based animal models are a useful alternative that provides valuable insight into these outcomes. spleens and blood of mice were analyzed at 7 - days post - simspace. transcriptomic analysis of the spleen displayed genes involved in signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization and dna repair pathways are altered."
1158,"Ldr, hlu, and simspace independently trigger divergent pathways post - exposure. post - hlu appears to produce a large number of transcriptional changes compared to post - ldr alone, indicating altered gravity may cause pronounced physiological impairments. 33 genes were downregulated and 95 genes were upregulated, compared to controls."
1159,"Multiple genes involved in metabolism were upregulated, including the insulin signaling receptor, igf2r. glycoprotein forming genes, b4galt2 and b4Galt3 were both upregulated. cell cycle pathways were also altered, including upregulation of genes sccca1, kif24, myh10, and tor1aip1. chromatin organization and remodeling genes chd3 and ncoa3 downregulation were also identified."
1160,"Alox5 is typically upregulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, gm - csf, involved in the generation of emergency myelopoiesis and activates matured myeloid cells into a pro - inflammatory state. trem1 is upregulated and is involved in amplifying inflammation of neutrophils and monocytes. Trem1 inhibition has been successfully shown to prevent mir - 155 - driven lung inflammation and injury."
1161,"Post - spaceflight anemic conditions persist, which may explain post - flight etiology during return to earth ’ s gravity in crewmembers 9 – 11. The overall contribution of immune responses on whole - organism physiology cannot be fully concluded until longitudinal phenotypic studies are performed, as mission timeframes vary."
1162," abnormal rbc shape suggest anemic outcomes occurred post - simspace. elevated rdw may be caused by elevated inflammation, which is also observed in our model. targeting inflammation early post - flight may avert cardiovascular - or cancer - related risks. An elevated rhd ( rh factor antigen ) was noted post -simspace, which may have been induced due to rbc loss."
1163," pathway analysis implicated bcl11a, aspn, and nedd4l are interconnected and regulate a wide variety of pathways. due to fluidic shifting and reduced normal loading in spaceflight, astronauts returned to earth are at an increased risk of low blood pressure when standing 12 and arterial stiffening. targeting these interconnected genes may provide a robust countermeasure suited to reverse both immune and cardiovascular disparities during readaptation."
1164,atological systems occur 7 - days post - protracted simulated spaceflight. ##atologicalsystems occur 7 days post-pursuit of simulated space flight. #atological system occurs 7 days after protracted simulatedspaceflight. #Systems occur seven days after prolonged simulated space spaceflight in simulated space.
1165,"The wasps leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their drosophila hosts. they produce extracellular vesicles ( evs ) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. ev interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success."
1166,"The lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite ’ s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics."
1167,Parasitoid ( parasitic ) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. drosophila and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses. The generalist leptopilina heterotoma ( lh ) succeeds on the drosphila species within and beyond the melanogaster group.
1168,"Lh ev proteins are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. mature evs are roughly 300 nm in diameter, packed with more than 150 proteins. lh evs lyse lamellocytes within a few hours of wasp attack, lb evs do not have the same effect. our immune - inhibition experiments suggested that lh ’ s ssp40 mediates ev interactions with lamellocyte."
1169,How a macro - endoparasite targets the hematopoietic system and accesses its progenitor population has not been studied. The modes of lh ev entry into these cells and the pathways of destruction are also not well understood. The goal of this study was to obtain a macro-level view of interactions with cells of the larval hemolymphatic system after infection.
1170,"Figures show an abundance of lh evs in the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, along the collagen / perlecan - based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors. High ev signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive psc unit. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose lh Evs using the classical rab5 - mediated retrograde retrograde."
1171,"Lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose lh evs using the classical rab5 - mediated retrograde transport ( rgt ) pathway. Surprisingly, rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, as rab5 kd leads to over - proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis."
1172," lh evs are present within the larval lymphatic system. lb17 attack triggers lamellocyte differentiation in the lymph gland cortex. Unlike antp > mcd8gFP - expressing pscs of naive and lb - infected lobes that remain tightly clustered, psc cells of lh - infected hosts are dislodged and some are distributed in the body of the lobe."
1173,"We stained lh - infected glands from fly strains with gfp - tagged collagen iv ( basement membrane, viking [ 41 ] ) or gFP - tagged proteoglycan core protein, perlecan / trol. In both cases, ev puncta were clearly localized with the continuous gFP signals of these extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins along the dorsal vessel as well as in the interstitial spaces around clustered hematopoietic progenitors ( yellow puncta in fig 2a – 2d ’ arrows ). surprisingly, punctate staining was also seen inside immature progenitor, adjacent to the dorsal vessels. evs were also observed inside some card"
1174,"Lh evs might inactivate the slit - robo signal, which might explain psc disassembly. To test this idea, we infected animals in which the slit- robo pathway was manipulated to promote constitutive signaling. In infected animals, evs congregated in regions adjacent to the psc, but were never found inside the pSc cells."
1175,"Lh infection of handδ > slit - n animals still promoted psc disassembly. evs might inactivate the slit - robo signal, which might explain pscdisassembly. While lh - infected uas - hid lobes lost progenitors and exhibited high levels of ev uptake, psc - less lobes remained intact."
1176," p1 staining revealed that lh infection does not block macrophage differentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that the psc plays a structural role in trafficking of evs from either the hemolymph or the dorsal vessel into the lobes. We next studied if ev uptake into hematopoietic cells occurs via rgt mechanisms. We therefore investigated if lh ev uptake depends on rab5, an early endosomal protein."
1177,"Rab5 rnai cells show peripheral punctate staining, presumably from intact evs, trapped in early endosomes, both in lymph gland and circulating hemocytes. in lamellocytes, the ev signal is diffuse and nuclear, and rab5 kd shows no change in staining intensity or distribution. rab5 - independent uptake mechanisms are involved."
1178,"Lh evs negatively impact phagolysosomal organization in macrophages. rab7 mediates late endosome formation and trafficking between late. endosomes and lysosomes is marked by rab7 and lamp1, respectively [ 47 ]. to evaluate if lh evS impact the rgt machinery, infected glands expressing gfp - tagged rab5, rab7, or lamp1 proteins were examined."
1179,"Rab5 suppresses proliferation and maintains the macrophage fate. We were surprised to find that pxn > gfp rab5 rnai animals developed melanized tumors. The hematopoietic population is significantly expanded and lamellocyte differentiation is robust, affecting viability."
1180,"Hematopoietic expansion correlated with increased mitotic index ( mi ) in lobes of tumor - bearing pxn > gFP rab5 rnai animals. normal rab5 function checks over - proliferation and ectopic progenitor differentiation. control “ flp - out ” clones without rab5. rnai contained small cells that did not express integrin -. β. experimental clones with rab5 Rnai had larger, f - actin - rich cells with a typical lamellocyte morphology."
1181,"Lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytose lh evs to protect the host from their detrimental effects. ev activities in turn promote their apoptotic death by disrupting their endomembrane system."
1182," lh evs ’ association with the ecm proteins around the lymphatic system cells suggests ways in which evs might recognize and home into the lymph gland hemocytes and cardiomyocytes. as has been suggested for slit - carrying vesicles, cardiac cells might provide a route for lh Evs to converge into the vicinity of the pscs."
1183,"It is possible that the psc may somehow “ recognize ” foreign entities. It might serve to protect the progenitor microenvironment by acting as a chemical or mechanical barrier between the vascular and hematopoietic cells. In this scenario, lh evs may be targeting psc cohesiveness to inactivate this barrier function."
1184,"Like microbes, lh evs are endocytosed and can damage the late endocytic compartments. this suggests that their biochemical activities may distort and damage intracellular membranes. lamellocytes utilize a flotillin / lipid raft dependent mechanism to internalize lb evs [ 68 ] and it is likely that lh Evs use the same or a similar pathway."
1185," virulence factors provide the armament for parasite success in the host / pathogen “ arms race ” insights from this model host - parasite system can influence our understanding of how parasite - derived factors have shaped the immune physiology of fly hosts. with the available descriptions of the lh and lb ev proteomes [ 15, 19, 23 ]."
1186,16-week-old female c57bl / 6j mice were sacrificed aboard the international space station after 37 days of flight ( rr - 1 mission ) and frozen carcasses returned to earth. rna was isolated from interscapular brown adipose tissue ( bat ) and gonadal white adipose tissues ( wat) spaceflight resulted in differential expression of genes in bat consistent with increased non - shivering thermogenesis.
1187,16 - week-old female b6 mice were sacrificed aboard the iss after 37 days of flight. frozen carcasses were returned to earth for tissue preparation and method validation as described 21. sensors in the habitats ( flight and ground ) monitored and relayed information including component temperature and humidity. gene expression study rna was isolated from individual bat ( n = 8 / group ) and wat ( n + 6 / group) samples.
1188,"Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on earth. ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~ 3 h post - landing. cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice."
1189,"The international space station ( iss ) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross - sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using nasa - archived microbial isolates collected from the iss potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes : antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure."
1190," microbial observatories have been established in a wide range of habitats to facilitate prolonged investigations into microbial communities. control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms. changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water - system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics."
1191,"Microbes in iss potable water is not surprising, given their presence in drinking water on earth. microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation / evolution of microorganisms. many iss potables are known to be strong biofilm formers. biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials."
1192,"In this study, we examined sixteen iss potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. in agreement with recent findings 43, we also observed burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity."
1193,"Strain and culture conditions strains were obtained from nasa and isolates were identified by 16 s rrna gene sequencing and / or a biochemical identification. strains were cultured at 28 – 29 °c in a humidified chamber for 1 – 10 days on the following solid media : tsa ( mp biomedicals, 091010717 ; difco 214530 ), r2a agar ( becton, dickinson, 218263 ), or mr2a Agar ( teknova, r0005 ) strains were individually cultured to stationary phase of growth."
1194,"Bacterial survival was scored by the dilution showing microbial growth. antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated using clsi ( clinical and laboratory standards institute ) guidelines ( supplementary fig. 5b ) 45. energy - metabolism tests the casein - pr agar media used for metabolism testing contained 1 % casein ( sigma - aldrich, 22090 ), 0. 5 % nacl ( s3014), 0. 15 % bacto yeast extract ( bd, 212750 ), and 1. 3 % agar."
1195,"Samples were stained with syto - 9 green fluorescent stain ( 10 mg / ml, nucleic acid stain, thermo fisher scientific s34854 ) for 15 min. Biofilms were imaged using a leica tcs sp8 lscm with sequential scanning. hemolysis test experiments were performed using the same methods for the ast studies, but instead used blood agar ( ba ; tsa with sheep blood, fisher r01200 )."
1196,Interspecies and mixed - species interaction testing individual strains were grown in r2a broth as described above. cells were centrifuged at 7000 r. p. m. for 15 mins and pellets were resuspended in fresh r2 a broth to concentrate by 10 times. equal volumes of the 10x - concentrated strains were mixed and 10 µl of these mixtures were drop - applied on 1. 5 % agar. different strains recovered from the same year were tested as one set to study mixtures of two species or all species.
1197,"We analyzed a nasa - provided list of iss potable water isolates preserved between 2009 and 2015 44. seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified gram - negative rods were represented from the list. burkholderiales, which includes the genera burkholderia, ralstonia, and cupriavidus, was the predominant order. The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated."
1198,"Table 1 shows strains used in this study. iss potable water isolates were recovered from the us system. the identifier is provided by nasa. the burkholderia cepacia complex ( bcc ) strains, indicated with *, were recently further re- identified 43. strain ( year - # ) identifier ( by n Nasa ) sample collection date microbial identification 2009 2009 2009 - 1 092160068 - 1 5 / 4 / 09 ralstonia pickettii 2009 - 2 092950004 - 2 9 / 22 / 09 sphingomonas sanguinis 2009 - 3 092570005 - 1 8 /4 / 09 cupriavidus metallid"
1199,"All strains were resistant to multiple drugs at the concentrations tested for this study. bcc and mesorhizobium isolates were highly resistant to most of the tested antibiotics. ralstonia, cupriavidus, and bcc isolates showed similar trends in antimicrobial susceptibility. we also examined whether carbohydrates or amino acids were the preferred energy source of the iss isolates."
1200,"The media contains casein and phenol red with 1 % lactose or 1 % sucrose. pink or yellow color indicates utilization of carbohydrate or casein amino acids. media containing congo red revealed that strains of r. pickettii, s. sanguinis and bradyrhizobium spp. were strong eps producers. The crystal violet - containing agar also indicated biofilm formation."
1201,"We used confocal laser scanning microscopy ( clsm ) to examine biofilm structures and production of the biofilm - related eps. single - strain biofilms were developed on sterile microscope glass cover slides. live or dead bacterial cells, eps compounds, and α - or β - linked polysaccharides were labeled by fluorescent dyes."
1202,"We found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of r. pickettii and s. sanguinis. The 2014 burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology. The passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype."
1203,"The 2014 burkholderia isolates that exhibited β - hemolysis also tested positive for beta - galactosidase, urease, and d - trehalose, which are uncommon for bcc strains. interspecies interactions between the paired isolates over a progressive time course were rated as negative, positive, or neutral."
1204,"Three distinct interspecies interactions were observed in this study. positive relationships were defined when one strain grew out toward and in some cases surrounded the other strain. negative relationships weredefined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction. for example, methylobacterium and s. epidermidis were either killed or their growth inhibited by burkholderia."
1205,"Mixed - species colony biofilm assays to examine microbial multispecies behavior by combining different strains isolated in the same year. strains were first individually cultured in liquid media, then equal ratios of either ( 1 ) two species from the same. year, or ( 2 ) all isolates from each year ( 2009, 2012, or 2014 ) were mixed and spotted as a single colony. morphologies of these mixed - species colonies were monitored for 10 days. distinct phenotypes were observed for each mixed- species colony that resembled the dominant species."
1206,"Microbial interactions within natural and artificial environments are typically investigated over a short period of time. longer - term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. our analysis using archived iss isolates showed that ralstonia and burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016."
1207,"We observed positive, negative, or neutral interspecies relationships with temporal dependent interspecies interactions. as the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0. 2 - micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely 8, 15, 74. as these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years ( e. g., 2012, 2014 ). our data corroborate this possibility. based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed inter species interactions."
1208,"Hemolytic burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in iss potable water samples confirms previous work by o ’ rourke et al. 43 and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. This is the first report that iss bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes."
1209,The study provides a comprehensive phenotypic investigation of iss potable water microbial isolates. The results of this study offer potential insight into how polymicrobial isolates may contribute to biofouling of onboard life - support systems and impact human health in space and on earth. understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance.
1210," summary measurements of telomere length in skeletal muscle stem cells ( muscs ), a rare cell population within muscles, provide insights into cellular dysfunction in diseased conditions. here, we describe a protocol ( cryo section mu scle q uantitative f luorescent i n s itu h ybridization ) using skeletal muscle cryosections. using a free software, telomeres are assessed on a single - cell level."
1211,"Cadaverine is a polyamine produced by plants and microbes. It has been shown to accumulate in plants under stress conditions and to inhibit primary root growth. Here, we show that cadavine affects arabidopsis root growth primarily by inhibiting the biotin biosynthesis pathway."
1212," microbiological characterization using molecular and culture - based methods was performed on leaves and roots. culture based enumeration and pathogen screening indicated the leafy greens were safe for consumption. surface samples of the veggie facility and plant pillows revealed low counts of bacteria and fungi. comparisons between pillow components, and plant tissue types from veg - 03d, e, and f revealed higher diversity in roots and rooting substrate than the leaves and wick."
1213,"Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the international space station ( iss ). these strains exhibited a phenotype similar to titan cell ( ~ 10 µm diameter ) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5 % co 2 conditions. genomic analyses indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results."
1214,"The emergence of double mutation delta ( b. 1. 617. 2 ) variants has dropped vaccine effectiveness against sars - cov - 2 infection. Although covid - 19 is responsible for more than 5. 4 m deaths till now, more than 40 % of infected individuals are asymptomatic carriers. Human host defense neutrophil α - defensin hnp1 and human cathelicidin ll - 37 peptide - conjugated graphene quantum dots have the capability to prevent the delta variant virus entry into the host cells."
1215,"The current global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( sars - cov - 2 ) is responsible for over 5. 4 million death till now. During covid - 19 infection, the spike protein s1 unit containing the receptor - binding domain ( s - rbd ) facilitates the virus attachment to humans by binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ( ace2 ) receptor in the nasal epithelial mucosal cells. The emergence of double mutant delta ( b. 1. 617. 2 ) variants, which contain the l452r and t478k mutations, has enhanced the binding affinity with ace2."
1216,"Graphene quantum dots ( gqds) exhibit size - dependent luminescence properties originating from the quantum confinement effects and edge effects. Gqds containing different surface groups such as carboxy, epoxy, and hydroxyl exhibit high water solubility, high surface area, excellent photostability, and biocompatibility."
1217,The lipid membrane. the lipid membrane is the membrane of the human body. The membrane is made up of cells that contain proteins and other molecules. The lipid membrane contains the proteins that make up the body's cells. The lipids are responsible for the structure and function of the membrane.
1218,"Mutations in the rpob gene have been shown to alter a number of global phenotypes, including growth, utilization of unusual nutrient sources, sporulation, germination, and production of secondary metabolites. The fitness cost of rifampin resistance can vary greatly depending upon the environment. This has important implications for understanding how microbes develop antimicrobial resistance in the absence of antibiotic selection."
1219,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a common condition in aging, diabetes, and in long duration spaceflights due to microgravity. We used link prediction algorithms to select drugs for repurposing to treat the condition. Key target genes that cause muscle. atrophy in the left and right extensor digitorum longus muscle tissue, gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and the left. and right soleus muscles are detected."
1220,Microbiome plays a pivotal role in regulating the health and behavior of the host. alterations in microbiome composition and function have been linked to various human diseases. understanding the impact of spaceflight and space conditions on the microbiome of astronauts is important to assess significant health risks that can emerge during long - term missions.
1221,"The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in - situ resources. using samples from apollo 11, 12, and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging and many plants were slow to develop and showed severe stress morphologies."
1222,"Plants are key components of the biological sciences within and in support of space exploration. as model organisms, plants provide insights into gravity, radiation, and other space - related biological phenomena. information on plant growth in lunar regolith, therefore, informs fundamental biology interactions within the lunar environment, and helps scale options for the use of plants in lunar life support scenarios."
1223,"The first contact between terrestrial biology and lunar regolith was an unprecedented concern for protecting both the astronauts visiting the moon as well as the entire earth biosphere from the potentially harmful effects of returned lunar materials. arabidopsis was seeded directly onto samples from apollo 11 ( 10084 ), 12 ( 12070 ), and 17 ( 70051 ) ( fig. 1a ), which represent diverse regolith types."
1224,"We used four replicate plates, each 48 - well cell culture plate contained four wells of jsc - 1a simulant and three of lunar regolith. lunar in situ images are publicly available from nasa archives. lunar samples used here contain 30 – 52 vol. % agglutinates, which are aggregates containing mineral fragments, nanophase metallic fe, trapped gases, and glass that form due to micrometeorite impacts."
1225,"Two of the lunar regoliths ( 10084 and 70051 ) are derived from high - ti basaltic bedrock and have tio 2 abundances of 5 – 7 wt. %, which is considerably higher than that of jsc - 1a. in its silicates and glass."
1226,"All seeds used in the experiment were from the same batch of seeds from arabidopsis thaliana. lunar regolith materials were provided by the lunar allocation analysis review board / aarb. four replicates form each site, alongside 16 replicates of jsc - 1a simulant ( also 900 mg each)"
1227,"Rockwool plugs in the growth plates were moistened with a nutrient solution of 0. 125× strength ms nutrient solution, ph 5. 7 ( murashige and skoog 49 ) by placing the plates in trays of the solution to soak the plugs from below, and then allowed to drain. The plugs wick liquid very effectively, but also drains readily and does not retain much water. this property of rockwool helped prevent the regolith from becoming waterlogged."
1228,"Plates of plants were photographed daily. between days 6 and 8, the seedlings were thinned to a single plant in each well by drawing out with forceps. on day 20 the aerial portions of the plants ( leaves and hypocotyl ) were harvested by cutting at soil - level with scissors to labeled micro - centrifuge tubes. samples were stored at −80°c until rna extraction."
1229," rna concentration was determined on qubit® 2. 0 fluorometer, rna quality was assessed using the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. libraries were constructed at the uf icbr gene expression core. sequencing was performed at the icbr nextgen sequencing core ( https : / / biotech. ufl. edu / next - gen - dna /, rrid : scr _ 019152 ). normalized libraries were submitted to the “ free adapter blocking reagent ” protocol ( fab, cat # 20024145 )"
1230,The library pool was diluted to 0. 8 nm and sequenced on one s4 flow cell lane ( 2 × 150 cycles ) of the illumina novaseq6000. The quality of the rnaseq sequence data was evaluated using fastqc and low - quality bases trimmed from the reads using trimmomatic 52. star aligner 54 was used to map high - quality paired - end reads to tair10 genome. gene expression values were calculated using rsem 55. hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were conducted to evaluate the association of the samples. deg lists were analyzed for overlaps using biovenn 57.
1231,"The plants were grown in sets on four replicated 48 - well growth plates, each composed of four samples of jsc - 1a controls. One of the replicates in apollo 11 did not provide viable rna, and so for the transcriptome analyses of ap Apollo 11 treatment n = 3, while the apollo 12 and apollo 17 treatments n = 4. The quantitative growth graphs in supplementary fig. 4 were derived from the daily photographs of the four replicate growth plates."
1232,"Young hypocotyls of brassica rapa and other dicots exhibit positive gravitropism. This positive curvature occurs at the base and is followed by the typical negative gravity - induced curvature. We examined the transcription of pin1, pin3, iaa5 and arg1 in curving tissue. transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting these genes affect differential elongation."
1233,Microbial observatory experiments on the international space station ( iss ) revealed the presence of various microorganisms that may be affected by the distinct environment of the iss. The low - nutrient environment combined with enhanced irradiation and microgravity may trigger changes in the molecular suite of microorganisms leading to increased virulence and resistance.
1234,alpha ( α ) klotho is a soluble transmembrane protein. It facilitates calcium - phosphorus homeostasis through feedback between bone and kidney. It is a potential systemic biomarker for bone - kidney health during spaceflight. We found that plasma αklotho was reduced after both spaceflight aboard the iss and hindlimb unloading ( hu) deficiency could be reversed with exercise.
1235,"The role of the kidneys in skeletal homeostasis is complex. Recent research interest includes the interplay between αklotho and fibroblast growth factor 23 ( fgf23 ) alpha klotho is secreted predominantly in the kidneys, whereas fgF23 issecreted by osteocytes. In non - weight - bearing climates with known bone density loss, αklOTHo and fg f23 may play a role in skeletalHomeostasis."
1236,"Pilot investigation measured circulating αklotho levels in mice after exposure to two reduced weight - bearing conditions. Microgravity aboard the iss, and after hind limb unloading ( hu ) 13. musculoskeletal degradation has previously been described in hindlimbs from these same mice after 35 days in microgravity and hu 14, 15."
1237,Plasma αklotho levels remained lower in the mice that performed no exercise [ hu - no exercise ] vs plasma from the full weight bearing mice as measured on day 30 ( p < 0. 05 ). These mice that had not performed exercise after the 30 day period of hu were also significantly lower than all ground groups on day 80. Running exercise for 49 days after the initial 30 day hu period resulted in partial recovery of plasma klotho.
1238," αklotho was lower than ground in plasma after 30 days hu, but recovery occurred with exercise. A mechanistic / causal link between weight - bearing conditions and the hormone is not determined. for hu mice, levels ofalpha increased following exercise, with partial recovery in the running group."
1239,"All mice were male, c57bl / 6 ( jackson labs ) that were 10 weeks at the start of each study. iss mission groups included flight and ground control. this investigation had access to n = 4 – 5 plasma samples / group collected after 35 days on orbit. All available samples were analyzed for this study."
1240,The assumption of equal variance was used to test equality of variance. analyses were performed using graphpad prizm 8. 4. 0. tests.

1241,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is the dominant microorganism aboard the international space station. This study used a computational approach to predict possible metabolic interactions in the iss microbiome and shed further light on its organization. The study underscores the importance of k. pneumoniae and its potential positive and negative interactions with other microbes, including potential pathogens."
1242,K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with aspergillus and penicillium species. The presence of k. pneumoniaes compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm - forming structures. The pantoea genus were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the iss microbiome.
1243,"The networks have been drawn on cytoscape for all three time points of the study by singh et al. 2018 : flight 1 ( f1 ), flight 2 ( f2 ) and flight 3 ( f3 ). the octagonal location nodes have been color coded according to the iss node they belong to. locations # 1, # 2 and # 3 belong to node 3; locations # 4 and # 5 to node 1; location # 6 ( not shown here ) to pmm and location # 7 to the us laboratory. the microbial nodes have were color - coded such that those existing at more than one location with k. pneumoniae are shown in grey."
1244,"P. rubens at location # 3 during flight 3, and k. oxytoca at locations # 2 and # 5 during flight 1. Using. ’ approach, microorganisms were knocked out one at a time from the community to estimate. the extent of benefit provided by that single microorganism to the remaining coexisting microorganisms. from the analysis, it was evident that some microorganisms do have an influence on the metabolic capabilities on the rest of the community."
1245,"The enterobacteriaceae family was often found to be the most beneficial of all clusters. We grouped organisms based on their phylogenetic affiliation. We removed these groups, one at a time, from the community to study the importance of a given family to the community."
1246," trichocomaceae have the highest documentclass [ 12pt ] { minimal] of the eleven communities under study. Erwiniaceae, paenibacillaceae, and paenibia have the lowest documentclass. The highest csi a → a ~ s in six out of a total eleven communities was in flight 3."
1247,"The heatmap has been facetted to indicate the three timepoints, i. e., flights pantoea species thrive in the support of the microbiome. The values on the tiles denote the community support index calculated in the presence of the family. The x - axis denotes the families present in the dataset, and the y - axis denote the respective locations."
1248,"Fig. 4 extent of metabolic benefit derived by an individual microorganism from its coexisting microorganisms. p. vagans was found to exhibit the highest dependency amongst all the pantoea, at location # 5 in flight 2 ( fig. 4 ). values of these species ranged between 0 and 6. 52 %."
1249,"The heatmap depicts the range of community support indices. derived by an individual microorganism from its coexisting microorganisms. values are represented as percentages. on the x - axis is the list of microorganisms in consideration, and on the y -axis is the flight number and the concerned location number."
1250,S. enterica exhibited the highest community dependence amongst all microorganisms. k. pneumoniae are beneficial to its coexisting microorganisms in every community. Four out of five organisms present at all instances are benefitted to a lesser extent in flight 1 compared to flights 2 and 3 ( fig. 4 and supplementary table s 7 ).
1251,"Most pantoea species were found to be highly dependent on k. pneumoniae, with msis at the higher end ( 4. 41 – 6. 46 % ) of the spectrum ( supplementary table s 8 ). with the exception of e. coli and s. enterica, the msi values of all other enterobacteriaceae members were find to be 0 % in the presence of k. pneumoniae."
1252," cytoscape was used to construct and visualize these networks across three flights : flight 1 ( f1 ), flight 2 ( f2 ) and flight 3 ( f3 ). the nodes are labelled with microorganisms that inhabit the site at that respective time point. the directed edges are directed from the metabolically supportive microorganism to the metabolites dependentmicroorganism. the color of these directed edges is mapped to the metabolic support indices ( msi ), represented as percentages."
1253,"There was no significant effect on the predicted growth rate of k. pneumoniae. with other klebsiella species, the interactions were predicted to be predominantly amensalistic. interactions with p. ananatis however were found to be commensal, with an observed increased growth rate. p. dispersa and pantoea sp. strain imh found to compete with k.neumoniae at their coexisting locations."
1254,"The interactions with rhodotorula sp. strain jg - 1b were found to depend on the flight and location in which they coexisted. k. pneumoniae increased the growth rate of r. toruloides in flight 1 at location # 1, whereas there was no significant effect on that of k. pneumoniae. in flight 3, location # 2. interactions with a. niger were observed to be parasitic, with an observed decreased growth rate. of a niger and an increased growth rate in k. pneumoniume. with penicillium species, k. Pneumoniae had an amensalistic effect on them."
1255,"K. pneumoniae increased the growth rate of r. toruloides in flight 1 at location # 1 ( fig. 6 and supplementary table s 9 ). details regarding the nature of interactions of other microorganisms in the community have been delineated. under normal gravity conditions, a. fumigatus was found to be healthy where conidiophore holding vesicle with healthy metulae and phialides harboring conidia were noticed. simulated microgravity affected the phialide structure and subsequently conidia - forming cells were not clearly visible."
1256,"The hyphae of a. fumigatus appeared to be healthy when grown under normal gravity and mostly dead when exposed to the simulated microgravity. The number of conidia were also less and on top of the conidia - forming cells the fungal morphological architecture changed. interpretation of image data was based on careful analysis of multiple images ( n = 100 ), not only on a single micrograph of each test condition."
1257,"K. pneumoniae was found to be persistent and dominant in zero - g stowage rack of all three flights. pantoea, klebsiella, staphylococcus, erwinia and penicillium were the dominant and persistent human microbial pathogens. metabolic interactions in the community broadly fell under the categories of amensalism and parasitism. the parasitic interaction under normal and simulated microgravity between k. pneumoniaE and a. fumigatus was experimentally checked."
1258,"K. pneumoniae cells were resistant to the quaternary ammonium compound concentration used as cleaning agents in iss. The members of the family sporidiobolaceae ( rhodotorula, pink yeast ) were isolated from the iss locations. Their antagonistic and parasitic behavior predicted during this study should be tested against opportunistic microbial pathogens to aid the development of appropriate countermeasures."
1259,"K. pneumoniae has been isolated from many aquatic and terrestrial environments, including iss. as well as in association with insects, animals and humans [ 45 – 49 ]. during this study [ 8 ] the metagenomic sequences of the opportunistic human pathogens associated with pantoea genus were p. agglomerans, p. conspicua and p. brenneri. whereas the plant pathogenic Pantoea species were not observed. The competitive metabolomic properties predicted by this study might be due to the assimilation of similar compounds for sustaining their growth."
1260,"Our study does have some limitations. The metabolic models used in the study are automated reconstructions, which despite gap - filling, could potentially contain gaps and blocked reactions. We assumed that each microorganism is capable of minimal independent growth and thus calculated the minimal medium required to support survival. It is possible that some of the interactions remain conserved, in richer media, although others may disappear."
1261,"This study offers a first glimpse into the metabolic interactions of the microbiome, upon which several hypotheses can be formulated for future experimental design. It is important to emphasize that our computational methodology studies microbes through a metabolic lens only, and in reality, other interactions may be plausible. metabolic interactions have been previously shown to be important drivers of community structure and microbial interactions."
1262,"Klebsiella and other enterobacteriaceae play a key role in mediating the metabolic interactions taking place between microorganisms in the iss. metabolic modeling, through a combination of graph - theoretic approaches and steady - state constraint - based modeling, paints a more comprehensive picture of possible microbial interactions, which are as yet inscrutable by experimental approaches."
1263,"This article reviews transcriptomic studies carried out from plants grown in spaceflights and in different ground - based microgravity simulators. Despite differences in plant growth conditions, these studies have shown that cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense response and photosynthesis are common altered processes in plants grown under spaceflight conditions."
1264,Plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems. The most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level. microgravity research onboard the international space station ( iss ) provides the most valuable information.
1265,"Plant growth systems have been flown on crewed vehicles including the soviet / russian salyut and mir, the american shuttle, the chinese shenzou, and the iss. continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of veggie and the advanced plant habitat."
1266,"Plants have undergone extensive duplications ( up to four times ) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes. this article revises the results of some relevant experiments performed in the iss during the last decade. The changes are related to the acclimation or adaptation of plants to survive, grow and develop under the altered gravity conditions."
1267,Biological research in canisters ( bric) experiments were performed in the nasa bric hardware. Bric - 16 consisted of three individual experiments performed by three research groups as part of the sts - 131 mission on the space shuttle discovery in 2010. All bric-16 flight samples were grown in darkness for 309 h ( 12 days and 21h ) and then fixed in rnalater in - orbit.
1268,"The absence of gravity may confound the signaling system, inducing inappropriate stress responses as a consequence. spaceflight conditions triggered the downregulation of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in col - 0 seedlings. most of these genes are expressed in root hairs ( class ii peroxidase genes ) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated."
1269,The bric hardware system has several limitations : one is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time. Other is the absence of orbit 1 g control which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects. genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in col - 0 seedlings.
1270,"The mission spacex crs - 4, launched on september 21, 2014, carried a new bric experiment with the aim of dissecting plant stress responses and revealing novel pathways for these responses triggered in space. rna sequencing after growing for 8 days on board the iss allowed the comparison of the transcriptomes of four a. thaliana ecotypes with ground - based control. transcripts from heat - shock proteins ( chaperones ) were upregulated, whereas peroxidase transcripts were downregulated in spaceflight."
1271,"Cvi - 0 enriched in genes involved in light stress, kinase signaling and cell wall modification. col - 0 was enriched in transcripts related to cold and sugar response. enrichment in responses related to oxidative stress response was detected. ler - 0 also showed no significantly over - represented processes because of the small number of genes changing their expression."
1272,"Plastid produced genes appeared differentially regulated in the flight samples, but they were not present in the proteomic data. alpha tubulin has the potential to enhance cytoskeletal organization and cell wall composition, thereby enhancing the structural integrity of cells in microgravity. growth in orbit substantially altered expression of thousands of genes associated with biological functions."
1273,8% ( 783 / 2249 ) of upregulated and 27. 5% ( 335 / / 1217 ) of downregulated overlapped across all genotypes. relatively smaller numbers of degs were found to be genotype - specific. These results would suggest that the upr does not have a broad involvement in the response to spaceflight but could play a partial role.
1274,"Microarray analysis showed that only 480 genes were differentially expressed in spaceflight samples in any organ. Most of these genes were not coordinately expressed among organs ( only 26 genes were common in roots, hypocotyls and leaves ). although each organ displayed unique patterns of gene expression in response to spaceflight, the genes were involved in the same functional processes."
1275,"The cara experiment ( characterizing arabidopsis root attractions, launched on spacex crs - 3, april 18th 2014 ) consisted of growing three arabids on phytagel plates for 11 days. after a growth period of 11 days, samples were harvested into kfts containing rnalater. The transcriptome responses in the root tips, which was the unique tissue used, showed that differentially expressed genes unique to each genotype were more abundant than those shared with another genotype. under light exposure, col - 0 showed the greatest number of genes differentially expression in spaceflight ( 297 ) and phyd changed the expression of 130 genes."
1276,"Under light exposure, col - 0 showed the greatest number of genes differentially expressed in spaceflight ( 297 ) phyd changed the expression of 130 genes and in ws only 71 genes were deregulated. If this differential gene expression is considered as a measure of the physiological adaptive response cost, the ws ecotype would be better adapted to spaceflight thancol - 0."
1277,The study presented strong evidence that alternative splicing plays a role in the process of molecular adaptation to the spaceflight environment in plants. The advanced plant experiments 03 – 2 also studied the hypothesis that skewing pathways play a large role in spaceflight adaptation via cell wall remodeling. The root length was not altered in either mutant line by spaceflight.
1278,"In spr1 seedlings the number of differential gene expression under spaceflight condition was less than in col - 0 seedlings. in sku5 seedlings, the spaceflight differentially expressed genes were five - fold and two - fold more than ws at 4 days and 8 days, respectively. the root length was not altered in either mutant line by spaceflight."
1279,"Many genes of the networks involved in the response to these stresses are differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. in roots, hypomethylated chh sites predominated whereas leaves showed a predominance of hypermethylated chH sites. in leaves, a 46 % of dmc - deg set were associated with reactive oxygen species ( ros)"
1280,"The two mutant lines are deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation. in met1 - 7 plants, a large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves was observed ( 72 out of 226 ), whereas in elp2 - 5, the large proportion was observed in roots ( 101 out of 120 ) suggesting that met1 plays a more important role in leaves and elP2 in roots, in the process of adaptation to spaceflight."
1281,"The response to spaceflight environment acts more directly through mechanisms regulated by elp2 than through those regulated by met1 ( paul et al., 2021 ). methylation levels in chg, chh, and cpg context tended to occur under microgravity conditions. These results indicate that alterations in the methylation of auxin - related genes and cell wall may play important roles in plants adaptation to microgravity."
1282,"One experiment was carried out on board spacelab tg - 2 ( launched on september 15, 2016 ) in plant culture box ( pcb ) hardware that controls the atmosphere, temperature, and hydrates the plants. The initiation of bolting ( start of peduncle growth ) was delayed under the ld condition on board spaceflight. 1793 genes were upregulated whereas there were 1669 downregulated genes in the spaceflight samples with respect to their corresponding ground control."
1283,"For the first time that ft and soc1 could be key genes for a. thaliana plants to integrate spaceflight condition stress signaling into flowering regulation pathways ( xie et al., 2022 ). the second experiment was carried out on the chinese recoverable satellite sj - 10 ( launched on april 6, 2016 ). the plant growth system used consisted of four growth compartments, illumination, photograph, air - flowing, heating, and humidity controlling system."
1284,The tropi - 2 experiment ( launched on space shuttle mission sts - 130 in february 2010 ) grew seedlings of arabidopsis thaliana landsberg erecta ( ler ) ecotype. The plants were photostimulated with blue or red light at seven gravitational acceleration levels.
1285,"Arabidopsis thaliana landsberg erecta ( ler ) ecotype were grown for 6 days within the emcs. for seedling growth, photostimulation and video recording, samples were contained in special cassettes equipped with a hydration mechanism remotely operated. ground control was performed in a laboratory incubator following the exact timeline and light treatments as the spaceflight experiment. tropi - 2 experiment was a duplication of the original tropi experiment because of the presence of toxic volatile substances in the hardware."
1286,"The tropi - 2 experiment was to study plant tropisms in spaceflight ( interaction between gravitropic and phototropic signals) samples from this experiment were also used to perform transcriptome analyses with rna was extracted from whole seedlings. This hardware allowed performing a 1 g - spaceflight control, these samples were compared with the 1 g ground control. This resulted in a large number of genes differentially regulated ( 230 ), many of them implicated in cell - wall development."
1287,"The seedling growth project ( sg) was another plant space experiment performed in emcs hardware. The project aimed at exploring if, and to what extent, specific light conditions could be applied to overcome, or at least mitigate the deleterious effects caused by the lack of gravity on plant growth."
1288,"The number of differentially expressed genes with respect to 1 g control decreased, with a remarkable exception of the low gravity level ( lower than 0. 1 g ), which is the one that resulted in the highest number of deregulated genes. In microgravity, light and photosynthesis go terms were enriched, whereas response to stress, response to chemicals, and response to hormones were enriched in low gravity. The more representative enrichment in moon gravity was related to cell wall and membrane structure. The general stress response detected in lowgravity level was explained as the consequence of competition between phototropism and the weak gravitropism signal."
1289,"Two knockout lines of nucleolin protein, nuc1 - 2 and nuc2 - 2, affecting the two variants of this gene in a. thaliana, were grown in the sg series spaceflight experiments. under red light photostimulation, ribosome biogenesis was the most significantly enriched category within the upregulated genes. on seedlings kept in darkness during the last 2 days of cultivation, gene categories involved in processes of cell division appeared promoted."
1290,"The “ plant signaling ” experiment, also carried out in the emcs ( launched in july 2011 aboard sts - 135 ), studied the transcriptional profiling of root samples exposed for 5 days under continuous light at microgravity or partial g. The analysis identified 101 genes whose expression levels were associated with gravity dose following three different patterns."
1291,"Mizuna plants grew as well or better under spaceflight environment than on the ground. In space - grown plants a total of 20 in 32 ros oxidative markers were upregulated more than two - fold, including the major ros - scavenging enzymes : thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. Two ros- producing genes ( nadph oxidase genes : rbohd and r bohf ) were up regulated 3 - fold and 5. 1 - fold."
1292,"5 days of exposure to microgravity did not cause detectable significant changes in gene expression, but caused an increased energy demand. This should be taken into consideration when plants will be used as part of bioregenerative supports on long duration space missions. The majority of these genes were involved in the stress - induced antioxidant system, signaling chains, and defense - resistance response. These genes were assumed as the effect of spaceflight - related environmental conditions."
1293,"One of the most striking molecular differences observed was the significant increase in expression of most heat shock proteins ( hsp ) and heat shock factor ( hsf) genes in spaceflight non - differentiated tissue culture cells. The expression changes in these two hsp proteins, as markers of late stress response, were studied in parabolic flights ( hypergravity and hypogravity alternation ) and in simulated microgravity ( 2d clinorotation ) by rt - qpcr."
1294,"The cellular expression logic experiment was a modification of the previous arabidopsis cell cultures experiment in bric - 16. In this experiment, launched on spacex crs - 2 to the iss on 1 march 2013, two mutant lines were used : arg1 ko and hsfa2 ko. The transcriptome analysis, after 10 days on orbit, showed that both mutant cell lines used substantially more and different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight - adapted state compared to wt cells. This led to conclude that a proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional hsf network and functional arg1 protein."
1295," cell cultures of arabidopsis thaliana were exposed to partial - g forces ( 0. 16 g, 0. 38 g and 0. 5 g) during parabolic flight and clinostat experiments. The results revealed that, in simulation by clinorotation, the least effects ( the lowest number of differentially expressed genes at least 2 - fold ) were obtained after 30 min at 0.5 g. genes coding for proteins involved in cell wall modifications, peroxidases, auxin - related proteins and transmembrane proteins were identified."
1296,"In another work, callus semi - solid cultures of a. thaliana were exposed for 200 min to two paradigms of simulated microgravity and hypergravity. The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed ( not reaching statistical significance ) when exposed to the unusual gravitational environments."
1297,"The effects on the overall transcriptional state of callus exposed to these altered gravitational environments were studied. microarray analysis indicated that barely a few genes were differentially expressed. However, using a detailed analysis based on clustering of similarly expressed genes it was found that gravitational and magnetic fields had a synergistic effect on the transcriptional profile."
1298,"Ceratopteris richardii spores were exposed to microgravity aboard nasa shuttle flight sts - 93 to identify the early cellular and molecular events associated with gravity signal perception and response. expression of genes related to cell cycle regulation function, cell organization, ribosome biogenesis and developmental processes were downregulated in the g2 / m population and upregulated in g1 population. abiotic stress response genes were upregulated. in theg2 /m population and downregulated significantly in theG1 population after 14 h of incubation."
1299,"The spaceship shenzhou mission also included one experiment to study gene expression in rice calli in response to microgravity. The functional analysis identified that the microgravity - response transcripts were associated with metabolism and signaling pathways of hormones, transcription factors, starch, glycolysis and the electron chain."
1300,The spaceflight environment of the international space station poses a multitude of stresses on plant growth. We used arabidopsis zigzag - 1 as a sensitized genotype to study the effect of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion. Our results indicate that microgravity enhances the zig - 1 phenotype by reducing hypocotyl growth in some cells.
1301,The international space station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions. introduction growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long - term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. effects of the spaceflight environment on the iss include reduced cell elongation 4 or altered cell division 5 in roots.
1302,"Wortmannin ( wm ), a chemical inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( pi3k ), can induce vacuole fusion in zig - 1. This treatment represents a unique assay for the study of organelle fusion in plants in space. zigzag1 has fragmented vacuoles and showed abnormal shoot gravitropism."
1303,We used wm - induced vacuole fusion in zig - 1 to study the effect of microgravity. formaldehyde - based tissue fixation was used and gFP - tagged vacuoles were imaged post - flight by confocal microscopy. We detected a mild but significant decrease in plant vacuol fusion. This highlights possible effects of micro gravity or other spaceflight stresses on vacuola biogenesis and membrane fusion.
1304," arabidopsis ecotype columbia ( col - 0 ) expressing gFP - tip2 ; 1 was previously described 39 and previously transformed 27 with the hdel - mcherry construct 40. seeds were surface sterilized and sown on 0. 5 x arabIDopsis growth medium ( agm, 0.5x murashige and skoog medium, 10 g / l gelrite, 1 % ( w / v ) sucrose ) each petri dish contained 30 seeds. 20 - two petri dishes were integrated into pdfus and stored in 4 brics for svt, evt and flight."
1305,"The final concentration for each buffer to test was 0.5x agm, 0. 5x or 0. 25x kpbs. seedlings treated with each mixture were immediately stored at 4 °c until confocal microscopy. for svt, evt and flight assay, 16 % pfa aqueous solutions were diluted to 8% pfa. cells in the elongation zone were identified as those past the transition zone. all seedlings were imaged at the root tip transition and elongation zones."
1306,"Seedlings were imaged using digital cameras. hypocotyl and root length was measured with fiji 64. to count the number of vacuoles per cell, images from different tissue and cell type was analyzed separately. three - way anova analysis was applied to compare the cellular vacuole amount among different treatments. statistical analysis and figure generation were conducted with graphpad prism version 9. 2. 0."
1307,The goal of bric - 24 was to test whether vacuole fusion is affected by the microgravity environment of the iss. sterilized arabidopsis seeds ( wt and zig - 1 with gfp - tip2 ; 1 ) were plated onto agm media and stored at 4 °c before bric- pdfu integration. treatment solution ( 33 μm wm or dmso buffer) was applied at day 4 of seedling growth followed by fixative solution 2 h later.
1308,"Each petri dish contained 30 seeds. treatment solution ( 33 μm wm or dmso buffer ) and fixative were injected into the dual chamber of the pdfu. plates were placed into each pdfus and pdfus were integrated into brics. four brics were then stored in a cold bag for the flight. after 4 days of growth on the iss, wm solution or dMso control were applied to the seedlings. the treatment lasted for 2 hours. the second actuation was conducted by applying fixative solution to the Seedlings. brics was then kept at 4 °c and returned to nasa after splash down. confocal imaging and data analysis were conducted"
1309,Pfa fixation solutions are made in pbs and many variations exist. Only the pfa solution in 0. 5x pbs showed the best preservation of vacuole morphology. preservation of er morphology as reported by the mcherry - hdel marker was even more challenging. one major concern for doing plant cell biology experiments in space is that fixed samples must be stored on the iss for several weeks before splash - down.
1310, ground tests demonstrated feasibility of the vacuole fusion assay using the bric - pdfu science. germination rate during svt was not significantly different between genotypes. multiple vacuoles were detected in zig - 1 roots in the control treatment and the wm treatment resulted in fewer Vacuoles per cell when compared to the control.
1311,"No significant differences in seed germination were detected between genotypes but zig - 1 hypocotyls were shorter than the wt. root cortical cells of the root transition zone were imaged for vacuole morphology ( fig. 2b, c ) and most wt cells contained only one vacuol regardless of treatment. multiple vacuoles per cell were observed in the zig-1 control, and wm treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of vacuols per cell in the mutant. these results suggest that chemical inhibitor treatments in the bric - pdfu are feasible, albeit adjustments must be made to accommodate changes due to the limitations of the hardware."
1312,"The feasibility of bric - 24 was demonstrated during evt, but the overall quality of gFP signal, seedling preservation and wm effectiveness was not on par with similar experiments outside the bric- pdfu hardware. this may result from the lack of precision when loading solutions into the dual chamber. we then tested whether deviations from the 1 : 1 ratio between the wm ( or dmso ) solution in agm and the fixative could affect the quality of cell fixation."
1313,"The iss environment resulted in 8. 46 % longer hypocotyls on the wt compared to ground control while the effect in zig - 1 was the opposite. wt roots were 13 % longer than zig-1 in both treatments and no differences were detected between the flight and ground controls in either genotype. These results suggest that seed germination and root growth of zig. - 1 are not affected by microgravity, but its hypoc.otyl growth may be inhibited by the stresses imposed by the iss environment."
1314,The primary goal for this research was to test whether wm can induce vacuole fusion of zig - 1 in the microgravity environment of the iss. All seedlings collected from bric - pdfus of flight assay and ground control were imaged by confocal microscopy. epidermal and cortical cells within the transition and elongation zones of the root tip were analyzed as changes in Vacuole morphology are readily observed in these cell transitions.
1315,"Four - day - old seedlings were treated with dmso buffer control or wm solution for 2 h. cells were imaged at the root tip epidermis transition zone. vacuole numbers in wm - treated plants was used as a proxy for vacuol fusion events ( fig. 4 ). as expected, the Vacuole number per cell in zig - 1 treated with wm was smaller than the dMso control for both flight and ground control samples."
1316,Amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells were found closely associated with tonoplast both for flight sample and ground control and in both genotypes. We could not analyze root statocytes in a similar manner due to low gFP fluorescence intensity in root columella cells. These results overall suggest that the microgravity environment of the iss does not appear to alter the association of vacuoles and amyloplast.
1317,Amyloplasts were associated with tonoplast ( labeled by gFP ) in hypocotyl endodermis of wt and zig - 1 in microgravity environment as on earth. Scale bar : 20 μm. The results were published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.
1318,"Microgravity environment of the iss enhanced the phenotype of zig - 1. wt seedlings had longer hypocotyls when grown on the iss. microgravity results in a mild decrease in vacuole fusion even though this can only be detected in this sensitized genotype. given the role of vti11 as a snare for protein trafficking, it is tempting to speculate that the microgravity environment may have a negative effect for endomembrane trafficking overall."
1319,Microgravity environment appears to delay wm - induced vacuole fusion in zig - 1 root epidermis. Vacuole number analysis indicated that wm was overall effective at inducing vacuoles fusion of zig-1 in microgravity inside the bric - pdfu. This underscores the feasibility of chemical inhibitor treatments in plants grown on the iss.
1320,"Previous cell biology experiments on the iss relied on tissue fixation followed by electron microscopy 9. tissue fixation protocols that are compatible with fluorescent proteins have been developed for plants 37, 38, 42. membrane vesiculation was observed in some fixed seedlings ( supplementary figs. 3, 7 ), and further optimization of the fixation protocol may improve the post - flight imaging of stored fixed samples."
1321,"Tissue fixation protocols that are compatible with fluorescent proteins have been developed for plants 37, 38, 42, 59. These protocols were developed to improve imaging depth within plant tissues by clearing cellular structures. maintaining subcellular structure and fluorescent protein structure and intensity allow for imaging experiments that are incompatible with live - cell imaging such as those conducted in space."
1322,The role of the viral spike glycoprotein ( s - protein ) has been clearly established in sars - cov - 2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan ( hspg ) and angiotensin - converting enzyme - 2. marine sulfated glycans ( msgs) have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. No correlations betweenmsg structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn.
1323,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( sars - cov - 2) has been responsible for over 6. 3 million deaths globally in a short span of 2 years. The vaccines have been able to prevent new infections and restrict the severe outcomes of covid - 19. The chances of reinfections in vaccinated people cannot be eliminated, especially with the rapid emergence of variants of the virus."
1324,"High pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acid mutations in its s - protein. The l452r, t478k, and p681r mutations are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility. Development of therapeutic strategies capable of inhibiting the infectivity of a broad range of emerging sars - cov - 2 vocs is critical."
1325,"The competitive inhibition of s - protein - hspg binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans ( gags ) or gag mimetics has shown a significant decrease in the sars - cov - 2 infectivity ( wuhan - hu - 1 strain ) ( jin et. al. 2020 ). In the current study, we investigate the anti - sars-cov - 2 activity of msgs comparatively against both the sar's wt and delta strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the delta variant would lead to any change in the activity of the msgs."
1326,"Bacterial behavior has been studied under microgravity conditions, but very little is known about it under lunar and martian gravitational regimes. An earth - based approach was designed and implemented using inclined clinostats and an in - house - developed code to determine the optimal clinorotation angular speed for bacterial liquid cultures of 5 rpm."
1327,The space environment includes unique hazards like radiation and microgravity which can adversely affect biological systems. We assessed a multi - omics nasa genelab dataset where mice were hindlimb unloaded and / or gamma irradiated for 21 days. We compared time - matched epigenomic and transcriptomic retinal profiles resulting in a total of 4178 differentially methylated loci or regions.
1328,Microgravity and space radiation are anticipated to impact biological systems and could potentially affect crew health and performance both in mission and once astronauts return to earth. resources aboard space assets that have a sustained human presence like the international space station are limited. ground - based analogs can also support the interrogation of biological effects from disparate stressors in isolation from one another that cannot be untangled in the spaceflight environment.
1329,"This is the first multi - omics study of longitudinal changes in the murine retina due to microgravity, low - dose radiation, or combined exposure to both. We observed similar epigenetic and transcriptomic discordance in genes reported in the nasa twins study 13 and in the retina of mice flown to space 11, with some changes persistent even 4 months after exposure."
1330,"The original study was conducted at loma linda university following recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals 50. A total of 59 six - month - old, female c57bl / 6 j mice were housed in cages of same dimensions and subjected to one of four experimental conditions. gamma radiation was delivered using 57 co plates placed underneath the cages and a dose rate of 0. 01 cgy / h was used to deliver a total dose of 0, 04 gy."
1331, raw rrbs reads were downloaded from genelab and processed with nf - core / methylseq pipeline. Fastqc was used for running quality checks on reads. adapter sequences were trimmed using trim galore! for cutadapt 57. methylation differences were also calculated over 100 - bp tiling windows to obtain differentially methylated regions 60. sites and regions were mapped to known genes ( mm10 assembly ) and known cpgs.
1332,Methylation differences were also calculated over 100 - bp tiling windows to obtain differentially methylated regions 60. sites and regions were mapped to known genes ( mm10 assembly ) and known cpg islands using genomation 62 and genomicranges 63 packages. promoter regions were defined as 2 kbp upstream and downstream of annotated transcription start sites. differentiallymethylated genes were defined. as genes containing at least one dml or dmr within their promoter region or gene body.
1333, regulated methylation targets are routinely clustered into short genomic regions. A lower threshold for methylation difference in dmr ( 2 % ) is recommended for enrichment analysis. An adjusted p - value cutoff of 0. 25 was used for detecting overlapping biological processes based on differential methylation and expression.
1334,"For both gene expression and methylation, each experimental group was compared to a control group ( no radiation or hlu ) with matched post - exposure duration. Significant differential expression was identified in eight out of the nine comparisons. While the samples clustered by time point / age based on global gene expression, they could be separated by exposure condition within each time point."
1335,"The number of degs peaked at 7 days for groups exposed to only hindlimb unloading ( hlu ) or irradiation ( ir ) and showed a subsequent decline. The 275 deg identified in 7 - days ir were enriched in ocular disease terms. In the 1 - month ir group, 7 out of the 31 deg showed > twofold change. prss56, a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia 16, was the only deg at 4 months after exposure to ir alone."
1336,"The highest number of deg within hlu + ir ( combination of hindlimb unloading and irradiation ) was detected at 1 month post - exposure with no deg at 7 days. prss56, a gene implicated in human and murine refractive development and myopia, was the only deg at 4 months after exposure to ir alone. overlapping differentially expressed genes across exposure groups nine deg were common between the hlu - only and ir - only groups."
1337,"In all exposure groups, hypermethylation was more frequent than hypomethylation. among the hypermethylated loci, a higher proportion of methylation differences were associated with cpg shores than with islands except in all three exposures at 4 months. conversely, more hypometHylated. loci overlapped with cPG islands than with shores in most of the groups except in. all three groups at 7 days."
1338,"The highest correlation in methylation difference across different exposures was observed at the same post - exposure time point. hypermethylation of bclaf3 promoter was observed in four groups. The top dmls shared across all three exposures were in cav2 at 7 days ( 30%) and grip2 at 1 month ( 20%) bcl11b, bClaf3, gse1, necab2, plec and tafa5 were each differentially methylated in five out of the nine groups."
1339,"Six genes ( adamts5, gse1, rbm15b, fscn2, satb1, tenm3 ) were shared across different time points after radiation exposure. processes related to epithelial morphogenesis were activated in the exposure groups, whereas all other processes were suppressed across the three conditions. top bp significantly enriched across all conditions 7 days after exposure."
1340," bp biological processes, hlu hindlimb unloading, ir irradiation, nes normalized enrichment score. processes that were significantly enriched at all post - exposure time points for a given exposure condition were evaluated. nucleotide metabolism and related processes were significantly enrichment in all nine groups. pdk1 is a kinase known to play a key role in regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and is involved in cellular response to hypoxia."
1341," processes related to microtubule dynamics were enriched exclusively in hlu alone. ir - specific bp included dna conformation changes, golgi organization, protein - dna complex assembly, and type i interferon response. at 7 days, bp related to proteasomal protein catabolism were suppressed in all groups. mammary gland morphogenesis was activated in ir and hlu + ir. at 4 months, glycerolipid metabolism, pigmentation, and brown fat cell differentiation were suppressed."

1343," revigo was used for reducing significant biological processes ( adjusted p - value ≤ 0. 05 ) exclusive to each exposure condition ( hlu, ir, hlu + ir ) or timepoint ( 7d, 1m, 4m ) to representative non - redundant terms. ora is conducted by iteratively counting the number of genes shared between a preselected input gene set and each annotated gene set. Only the hypermethylated genes resulted in significantly over - represented processes."
1344,"A total of 23 genes showed changes in expression and methylation at an adjusted p - value cutoff of 0. 05 ( table 3 ). eef1a1, a protein involved in peptide chain elongation, was down - regulated and hypomethylated in groups exposed to radiation or microgravity 7 days post - exposure. crystallin crybb3 and signal - induced proliferation - associated sipa1l3, both implicated in cataract, were up -regulated and hypermethylated."

1352,"Spaceflight is an environment to which earth - based biological systems have not yet adapted. changes in gravity as well as radiation exposure that differs from terrestrial radiation are the two primary naturally occurring hazards the human body contends with during space travel. while hazards will be experienced concurrently in spaceflight, important information about the potential interactions between hazards can reveal how impacts can be appropriately mitigated."
1353,"Several genes known to be implicated in ocular diseases were found to be impacted at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. A subset of the 7 - days radiation only deg were enriched in nuclear and congenital cataracts, however, these genes were not dysregulated at 1 month or 4 months. retention of hypermethylation was observed in genes involved in eye development and pathogenesis."

1355," genes involved in wnt signaling also appeared as members in processes enriched in 4 - months hlu + ir. collagen fibril organization was over - represented with three overlapping constituent genes. temperature homeostasis was enriched in 7 - days hlu, and has been shown to be impacted by hindlimb suspension in a previous study."
1356,"The number of samples was limited with only a total of 59 mice. ground - based low - dose gamma or x - ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space - relevant radiation exposures on different tissues / systems. Despite limitations mentioned below, our study provides confidence that murine models can provide an understanding of molecular mechanisms and pathways contributing to ocular function as a response to spaceflight stressors."
1357,"Ground - based low - dose gamma or x - ray radiation studies are often used to study the effect of space - relevant radiation exposures ( in terms of total dose ) on different tissues / systems 6, 47, 48 as to inform future space radiation experiments. However, further studies should be implemented with higher dose gamma radiation and gcr simulations to leverage a more realistic space radiation analog."
1358,"Space microgravity ( spc - µg ) has consequences on the astronauts’ health, in particular, neural and cognitive functions. neural stem cells ( nscs ) are the basis for the regeneration of the central nervous system ( cns ) cell populations. learning how weightlessness impacts nSCs in health and disease provides a critical tool for the potential mitigation of specific mechanisms leading to neurological disorders."
1359,"Single - cell rna sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptomics have experienced rapid development in recent years. However, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight gene expression datasets available, only a few used scrna - seq and srt."
1360,"To gain a comprehensive understanding of how spaceflight affects the human body, the molecular responses of the body to spaceflight factors must be robustly profiled. The spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on earth. It is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards."
1361,Bulk transcriptomic assays are currently the most common omics assay performed in space biology. More than 270 transcriptomic datasets are available from spaceflight and spaceflight - analogue experiments in the nasa genelab database. The collection protocols for cells and tissues obtained from experiments in spaceflight have not yet been optimized for the application of these methods. The optimal tissue preservation protocols that should be implemented to ensure the success of these experiments are discussed.
1362,The study looked at the transcriptomic response of caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity. It found that 75% of the simulated. microgravity - induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground. conditions for four days. Most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. The study identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated micro gravity - and space - exposed worms.
