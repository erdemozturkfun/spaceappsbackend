3,PMC10233975,introduction,0,"introduction since the publication of the first metagenome - assembled genome ( mag ) in 2004 [ 1 ], mags have been used to confirm genomic data for taxonomic identification of uncultivated microorganisms, metabolic profiling, microbiome dynamics, and host - microbe relationships [ 2 ]. when a mag is assembled, annotation and interpretation of genes are possible, allowing researchers to better understand the metabolic potential of the microbe, including its potential resistance to antibiotics, interactions with other microbes in the microbial community, and association with a host [ 3 ]. mags have been successfully used to discover uncultivated species [ 4 ], candidatus organisms like candidatus amarolinea aalborgensis gen. nov., sp. nov. [ 5 ], and novel genera like spiribacter [ 6 ] and kalamiella [ 7 ]. mags have also been used to recover genomic clusters of secondary metabolites [ 8 ], genetic mobility [ 4 ], metabolic pathways [ 9 ], and in situ replication [ 10 ]. projects retrieving thousands of mags have also been documented to understand yet - to - be cultured microbiomes of cow rumens and other environmental samples [ 11 ]. in addition, mags have revealed new microbial phyla, which have expanded the tree of life [ 12 ]. lowering sequencing cost, curated data availability in public database, and advances in computational biology have made assembling mags from complex and extreme environments easy. a higher number of reference genomes makes the binning easier and more reliable. multiple best practices are available to construct accurate and complete genomes from metagenomes, but high - quality mags are still relatively rare. most mags reported in many mag - related papers have completeness levels between 50 and 60 % [ 13 ]. recently, mags generated from international space station ( iss ) environmental metagenomes paved a way to describe a novel genus and species, kalamiella piersonii [ 7 ]. we have retrieved four k. piersonii mags ( 100 % genome sequence identity ) from iss environmental metagenomes that allowed us to identify a cultivated isolate archived from the same samples using gene - specific assays [ 7 ]. this “ genome to phenome ” approach enabled the differentiation of closely related genera pantoea from kalamiella and facilitated the isolation of several iss strains ( n = 7 ) that were archived and previously unidentified [ 7",Characterization of metagenome-assembled genomes from the International Space Station,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10233975/,Orbit,2023

34,PMC10751425,introduction,0,"introduction age ‐ related muscle decline, termed ‘ sarcopenia ’, is classified as a specific disease associated with numerous health risk factors in the elderly, prevalent in at least 10 % of older populations 1 and up to 31 % as a co ‐ morbidity. 2 despite associated annual healthcare costs that run into the billions 3 and significant impacts on individual quality of life and all ‐ cause mortality, 4 efficacious treatment strategies against sarcopenia remain limited. physical activity plus targeted nutrition represents the most effective chronic modifiable lifestyle strategy against sarcopenia. 5 however, ageing muscle growth responses to these interventions are sub ‐ optimal, 6 and certain older individuals can be unable ( i. e., through injury and / or access to exercise facilities ) or unwilling to participate in regular vigorous activity. indeed, ~ 50 – 70 % of those aged 75 + years are physically inactive, 7 meaning complementary pharmaceutical therapies are relevant to a significant portion of the ageing population. established drugs that modify human muscle ageing are limited, and importantly, many of these drugs display variable therapeutic efficacy and associate with harmful side ‐ effect profiles that render them inappropriate for long ‐ term clinical use. for example, rapamycin holds variable efficacy against sarcopenia indices across health and disease 8 but is a potent immunosuppressant 9 unsuitable for chronic use in otherwise healthy humans. drug identification efforts might instead focus on repurposing existing clinically approved compounds for sarcopenic indications as a realistic, immediately employable approach to therapeutic discovery. bisphosphonates are chemically stable derivatives of endogenous inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of multiple biosynthetic reactions and present in most tissues, including muscle. 10 recapitulating the effects of inorganic pyrophosphate, bisphosphonates inhibit calcification and lower hydroxyapatite degradation, 11 while also promoting osteoclast apoptosis to effectively protect against bone loss. as such, bisphosphonates have become a standard clinical strategy against osteoporosis and a variety of skeletal conditions. 12 yet skeletal muscle health and bone function are inextricably linked : effective mechanical coupling and endocrine muscle ‐ bone communication is essential to muscle and bone health, 13 with sarcopenia and osteoporosis often presenting together. 14 osteoporosis patients prescribed alendronate or pamidronate ( the most popular first ‐ line bisphosphonates ) for between 6","Bisphosphonates attenuate age‐related muscle decline in

( g0 lh wasps were not available for this experiment. ) lymph glands from uninfected g1 or s1 hosts do not possess evs ( figures s7 g – s7n ). thus, spaceflight does not affect the entry or distribution of lh evs in the hemolymphatic system. perturbation of lb and lh ev gene expression the venom fluid containing the evs is injected into the host during oviposition. due to their close association with and direct effects on target hemocytes, 17, 20 our definition of virulence proteins in this study is restricted to those that make up the evs. since standard annotations of wasp transcripts are not available, a custom pipeline was developed to analyze gene expression changes against corresponding transcriptomes ( figure s8 a ). overall, in adult male and female wasps, the effects of spaceflight were detected ( figures s8 b and s8c ), although they were modest, and less than 1. 5 % of all transcripts identified showed significant change when compared to respective ground controls ( 293 and 310 transcripts, for lb17 and lh14, respectively ). a majority of the transcripts were downregulated in both wasps ( figures 8 a – 8c ; tables s2 and s3 ). furthermore, the intensity of gene expression change was also mild. of the downregulated degs ( adjusted p < 0. 05 ), more than 80 % showed log ( 2 ) - fc between −1. 00 and −2. 00 ( 228 / 280 in lb17 and 250 / 261 in",Drosophila parasitoids go to space: Unexpected effects of spaceflight on hosts and their parasitoids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10797188/,Orbit,2024

146,PMC10831389,introduction,0,"1 introduction skeletal muscle strength is critical for operational health and safety for astronauts upon the international space station and future missions to the moon and mars. exposure to microgravity ( or microgravity analogs ) is well known to elicit musculoskeletal alterations in humans and in rodent models. 1, 2, 3 to mitigate these losses, nasa has instigated strict requirements for exercise interventions on the international space station ( iss ). however, these interventions are time - consuming ( h / day ) and do not fully mitigate musculoskeletal losses. 4 additionally, while certain exercise modalities are available on the iss, such as the advanced resistive exercise device ( ared ) and a specialized treadmill system, given the space limitations for the upcoming artemis missions to the moon and future missions to mars, exercise may not be a viable option for early expeditions to such locations. therefore, a more thorough understanding of musculoskeletal physiology will be necessary to develop other interventions to mitigate micro - and partial gravity - induced alterations to muscle health. one of the key areas of interest for astronaut health is to ensure a thorough understanding of biological sex differences during exposure to reduced gravity environments. while prior crewed missions may have been disproportionally male, the current artemis class of astronauts is 50 % male and 50 % female. 5 additionally, commercial spaceflight appears to be quickly becoming a reality, with future customers of this enterprise likely comprising approximately 50 % males and 50 % females. therefore, understanding the influence of biological sex on muscle outcomes is imperative to developing interventions for safe space travel. recent articles have detailed baseline differences in male and female muscle fiber type distribution and metabolic activity. 6 disuse atrophy is known to differentially influence different fiber types, providing physiological plausibility for sex differences in the etiology of disuse atrophy. one of the key experimental models for investigating spaceflight - induced musculoskeletal deteriorations is hindlimb unloading, which entails rodents being elevated from their cage floors by their tail or hip harness. this position completely removes gravitational loading from the rodents ’ back paws and elicits a fluid shift towards the head, similar to spaceflight. extensive literature has been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews. 7 experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been",Sex differences in muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10831389/,Orbit,2023
147,PMC10831389,introduction,1,"been published using this model, which has been elegantly described in previous reviews. 7 experimental research using hindlimb unloading to investigate the influence of biological sex on the progression of musculoskeletal deficits after disuse have been conflicting. one study noted that female rats better maintained muscle function compared to males after 14 days of unloading. 8 in contrast, others have found female mice had exacerbated muscle loss compared to males within seven days of unloading. 9, 10 these phenotypic differences were accompanied by a relatively greater reactive oxygen species induction, greater autophagy induction, and lower protein synthetic rates in females compared to males. 9, 10 moreover, an additional study found that female mice responded more favorably to mitochondrially - targeted catalase as a therapy to mitigate disuse, compared to males. 11 however, it should be noted that others have not found mitochondrially - targeted catalase to mitigate disuse - associated atrophy in either males or females. 12 one key difference between males and females is differences in major circulating sex steroid hormones, with testosterone being a key sex steroid hormone for males and estradiol being a key sex steroid hormone for females. a comprehensive review of each of these hormones ’ function in relation to muscle health is beyond the scope of this paper and has been detailed elsewhere 6, 13, 14 ; however, it is clear that both hormones are important for muscle size and strength. what is uncertain is if these steroid hormones contribute to sex differences in musculoskeletal losses during atrophy, or conversely if these hormones potentially mask inherent musculoskeletal differences between males and females. understanding the influence of sex steroid hormones on muscle loss is important for understanding basic muscle physiology as well as possibly developing interventions to mitigate muscle loss for astronauts. the aggregate of the studies to date is far from a consensus on how or if females may respond differently to a micro - or partial - gravity environment. moreover, considering the timeline of prior studies ( 0 – 14 days of disuse ), questions remain on whether sex differences exist, and if they would persist with longer durations of unloading. additionally, while mechanistic studies investigating alterations in cellular signaling are undoubtedly critical for an in - depth understanding of muscle biology, they do not address whether the muscle will have different functional capacity after exposure to micro - or partial - gravity. alterations to muscle function will be imperative for nasa to determine how to optimize operational effectiveness",Sex differences in muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10831389/,Orbit,2023

161,PMC10831389,discussion,0,"4 discussion there remains scientific controversy on how biological sex may influence the trajectory of diseases. our study builds on prior research in this domain 8, 9, 10, 11 and concurs with prior literature finding females appear more susceptible to disuse atrophy relative to males. these differences are more pronounced during mechanical unloading and suggests females may need more therapeutic interventions to attenuate musculoskeletal losses upon exposure to different gravitational environments. moreover, these sex differences were present regardless of the presence or absence of sex steroid hormones ; this strongly implies that sex differences in musculoskeletal pathologies are more complex than simple differences in the sex steroid hormone milieu. our data demonstrate that females experience greater relative loss across various components of muscle health in simulated micro - and partial - gravity environments, including muscle size ( figs. 2, fig 3, and fig 5 ) and muscle strength ( fig. 4 ), compared to males. these data agree with prior studies in mice undergoing short - term exposure to disuse atrophy, 9, 10 but conflict with recent works in rats undergoing 14 days of disuse. 8 although sparse, human data on disuse also appear to suggest that females have slightly worse musculoskeletal outcomes with disuse compared to males. for example, in a recent study of immobilization in humans, females had lower force relative to muscle volume after arm immobilization whereas males did not have these changes. 19 although males tended to have greater loss in muscle area, females appeared to have greater alterations to intrinsic muscle force. 19 additionally, in patients within the intensive care units, females have greater reductions in handgrip strength compared to males. 20 other studies in humans have found comparable rectus femoris area loss between males and females after undergoing immobilization for a femoral fracture. 21 in aggregate, our data appear to generally be consistent with prior studies investigating the influence of biological sex and musculoskeletal outcomes during disuse, with females tending to have exacerbated musculoskeletal loss during exposure to unloading compared to males. it is noteworthy that we found ovx / cast had little effect on overall differences between males and females. if sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. yet, we find that sex differences remain and",Sex differences in muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10831389/,Orbit,2023
162,PMC10831389,discussion,1,"if sex differences were purely attributable to differences in circulating sex steroid hormones, we would anticipate sex differences to disappear or at least be mitigated with removal of such sex hormones. yet, we find that sex differences remain and, if anything, are enhanced after gonadectomy. our previous studies using these same rats demonstrated that a lack of testosterone during unloading had little effect on muscle losses during exposure to either 0g or 0. 4g. 15 in contrast, although subtle, ovariectomy appeared to exacerbate musculoskeletal losses in females. 15 taken together with the current analysis, it is conceivable that conditions, which result in changes to ovarian derived hormones, may in fact exacerbate sex differences between males and females. the relationship between changes in estrous cycle and subsequent muscle size is supported by multiple prior studies across multiple conditions associated with muscle loss. 22, 23, 24 regardless, our finding that presence of gonadal derived hormones does not solely mediate sex - based differences in the trajectory of musculoskeletal loss suggests that other factors in addition to gonadal hormones contribute to the observed sex differences. it is possible differences in chromosomal make - up between females and males ( i. e. xx vs xy ), and subsequent gene expression may be underlying these differences unloading - induced muscle atrophy. however, that specific research question is beyond the scope of the current investigation. additionally, we must acknowledge that due to the design of the study we cannot specific precisely which hormones may be contributing directly or indirectly to these findings. we must acknowledge that our results are in opposition of a prior report by our group using the same hindlimb unloading technique in rats to investigate the influence of biological sex and muscle loss during disuse. 8 it is not entirely clear what may account for the discrepancies between these studies. it is possible that the duration of unloading between our current investigation and the prior study ( 28 v. 14 days of simulated 0g ) could account for such differences ; however, this explanation seems unlikely as prior studies using shorter durations ( 1 – 7 days ) of disuse have found female mice tend to have worse skeletal muscle outcomes relative to males. 9, 10 it is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of at",Sex differences in muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10831389/,Orbit,2023
163,PMC10831389,discussion,2,"muscle outcomes relative to males. 9, 10 it is worth noting prior studies comparing males and female rodents during disuse have provided some mechanistic explanations why females may have exacerbated muscle loss compared to males such as greater induction of atrophy - related genes 10 as well as greater relative induction of reactive oxygen species compared to males. 9 we speculate that strain differences ( wistar v. fischer ) may play a role in the differences noted between our study and the prior work. first, wistar rats are outbred strains of rats compared to fischer rats, which are inbred. theoretically, inbred animals should have reduced genetic variability and hence less variability. however, recent works have demonstrated inbred rats strains to overall have greater genetic variation than would be expected in inbred rat strains. 25 there has been extensive debate on the scientific validity and utility of outbred vs. inbred strains, 26, 27 which is beyond the direct scope of this investigation. regarding which strain is a more accurate representation of humans, it is difficult to directly speculate based on the current data. however, given there is human data to complement the current study, 19, 20 it is at minimum physiologically plausible the fischer rat is an appropriate recapitulation of human physiology for the current investigation. differences between males and females can be inherently difficult to analyze and interpret as males are typically larger than females ; therefore, comparing means or raw change scores may hide potential sex differences. moreover, because males tend to be larger from the initiation of the study, baseline measurements may interact with the overall trajectory of muscle loss. it would not be feasible to match males and females on body weight or muscle strength at the initiation of the study as that would result in either males being smaller than average for their age or females being larger than average for their age. therefore, for this study we opted to utilize a relative change score ( percent change ) and account for baseline differences with a covariate. we believe this analysis strategy allows for more robust conclusions regarding the influence of sex on the progression of muscle loss during exposure to micro - and partial gravity environments. to facilitate this method of analysis for future researchers, we have included our statistical code used for the study in supplementary files. 18 it is noteworthy that many of the sex differences we saw between males and females were present to a greater extent at 0. 4g compared to 0g. we postulate the 0g intervention is a more severe stimulus, which will likely maximize musculoskel",Sex differences in muscle health in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10831389/,Orbit,2023

168,PMC11022651,introduction,0,"introduction human spaceflight frequency has increased over the last decade, and with it, our grasp of its effects on human physiology. despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. the space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity ( e. g. weightlessness ), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long - term human presence in space. additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes ( e. g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome ), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others [ 1 ]. moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. indeed, there appears to be a reduction in t cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of tnf - α, interleukin - 8, interleukin - 1ra, thrombopoietin, vegf, and various chemokines ( ccl2, ccl4, cxcl5, etc. ) associated with spaceflight [ 2 ]. to date, almost all space missions have been led by professional astronauts from government space programs. more recently, however, spacex launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the inspiration4 ( i4 ) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. the present i4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short - duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post - flight and long - term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. this includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to earth [ 3 ]. both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age - related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells ( hscs ) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. clonal hematopoiesis is associated","Genome and clonal hematopoiesis stability contrasts with immune, cfDNA, mitochondrial, and telomere length changes during short duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11022651/,Orbit,2024

( 2005 ) describe that, although the percentage of cd14 + monocytes was not significantly reduced in astronauts following spaceflight, days after landing, the ability of these cells to engulf pathogens, degranulate, and mount an immune response was reduced compared to that of ground controls [ 36 ]. though little is known about the influence of spaceflight on dendritic cell function, their role in inflammation is well characterized as they play key roles in modulating cytokine production, mediating migration, and enhancing antigen capture and processing [ 37 ]. finally, while the long - term effects of short - duration spaceflight on the immune system and the genome are minimally understood, particularly in civilians and first - fliers, these data are critical as we expand human presence in orbit and deep space. additional studies are needed across varying cell types, mission duration, and crew background, which can also help guide countermeasures. of note, the short - duration space shuttle studies revealed decreased lymphocyte response, post - flight neutrophil increase, and eosinophil decrease, correlating with in - flight stress rather than microgravity [ 28, 38, 39 ]. latent herpesvirus reactivation and cytomegalovirus shedding were also observed during space shuttle flights [ 18 ]. similar adaptations occurred during iss missions, as crew members experienced mild infectious diseases, atypical allergies, or dermatitis without significant operational impact [ 18, 32 ], which seemed to be a function of mission duration. a","Genome and clonal hematopoiesis stability contrasts with immune, cfDNA, mitochondrial, and telomere length changes during short duration spaceflight",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11022651/,Orbit,2024

236,PMC11166943,introduction,0,"introduction humanity may be on the brink of establishing a new era of interplanetary space exploration that would witness crewed missions beyond low - earth orbit ( leo ) and a growing commercial spaceflight sector that would prompt a wider health range of individuals entering space compared to the selective cohorts of distinctively fit professional astronauts from previous generations. numerous space organizations across the globe openly aspire toward landing humans on mars in the coming decades, underscoring an overall international interest in what may be the next stage of human space exploration. prominent examples include the spacex mars program striving to initiate the first crewed mars spaceflights in the late 2020s ; the state - owned china academy of launch vehicle technology announcing the country ’ s goals to place humans on mars in 2033 ; nasa ( national aeronautics and space administration, the united states space agency ) issuing the authorization act of 2017, which declares objectives to send humanity to mars in the early 2030s ; roscosmos ( the russian space agency ) publishing aims to send humans to mars in the early 2040s ; and the united arab emirates publishing the mars 2117 project, which outlines a one - hundred - year plan to construct habitable communities for humans on mars. thus, there is a motive for scientists across the world to study how the human body responds to spaceflight and to develop countermeasures that improve the health and safety of crewed interplanetary missions. since the inception of human spaceflight, the duration that astronauts spend in space each mission has increased over time ( fig. 1a ). despite this, to date, only eleven individuals have resided in space for more than 300 consecutive days. pioneering crewed missions to mars would see humans embarking through space for even longer consecutive periods of time and in radiation environments for which there is limited knowledge about the impact on human physiology, warranting improvements in the autonomous space telehealth field. the risk of an emergency medical occurrence during space missions has previously been estimated at approximately 0. 06 per person - year, which roughly equates to one event every 2. 4 years for a crew of seven 1. multiyear planetary missions would prevent resupply and medical evacuation options and hence would require fully autonomous telehealth and triage protocols. fig. 1 space missions. a violin plots showing the average time a given astronaut spends in space per mission ( calculated as total time in space divided by number of missions ) compared to the decade the astronaut first went into space. astronauts are colored by the number of missions they have",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024

240,PMC11166943,introduction,4,"discipline, issop may be uniquely positioned to support the development of an informed framework early on that can help maximize scientific discovery and minimize ethical problems for an upcoming era of human space omics. in this paper, we consider how a future of precision space healthcare could improve the safety of human health during long - term spaceflight. we then discuss how careful standardization of space omics data is one component that may help implement this goal. to this end, we propose the development of a human cell atlas under spaceflight environmental conditions that could assist as an openly available, global resource for foundational space life science research. we then consider the complex ethical, cultural, and legal challenges intrinsic to the general discipline of human space omics, and how philosophical frameworks would likely need to be established with perspectives from international ethicists. precision healthcare in space in the coming years, the spaceflight field will likely observe diversification of the flying population, extended mission durations, and exposure to harsher radiation beyond leo. these factors motivate an upgraded space healthcare model where nutritional, supplemental, and pharmaceutical decisions could be tailored to multiple characteristics 12, 13. on earth, there are already applications of precision health, where healthcare is informed based on omics, environmental, and lifestyle factors 14. it seems probable that as connections between omics and spaceflight health ailments are slowly elucidated, similar approaches could be implemented in space. the purpose of customizing spaceflight healthcare would not be to reduce spaceflight participation, but to promote the health of increasingly diverse participation that better reflects the sustained presence of the full inclusive range of humanity in space one day 13. countermeasure protocols for space missions can consist of evidence - based nutritional supplements, exercise regimes, stress - relieving techniques, and pharmacological interventions 15. moving forward, crew profiles could potentially improve medical risk assessment and countermeasures ; optimize medical and nutritional payloads ; increase crew safety and efficiency ; and maximize the likelihood of mission success. in the next section, we will explore examples of how astronaut health and performance can be impacted by omic differences related to the metabolism of drugs, micronutrients, and macronutrients. we focus on metabolism because changes in mitochondria, the key hub of metabolism, are a fundamental biological feature of spaceflight 16. we note that the provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health - related importance. as",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
241,PMC11166943,introduction,5,"of metabolism, are a fundamental biological feature of spaceflight 16. we note that the provocative nature of the spaceflight environment may induce a large number of physiological and molecular changes on rapid time scales that may not necessarily be of health - related importance. as a result, scientists must cautiously avoid overassociating spaceflight omics changes with clinical meanings. indeed, most human gene association studies on earth are associative with many genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) providing initial results that failed to hold up upon further testing. the risk of overinterpretation is particularly relevant in the field of human space omics given the small sample sizes and the small number of studies 3 ; the difficulty of securing suitable ground controls, both in omics and environment 3, 17 ; and the long number of years required to replicate findings. these problems are further amplified when studying the long - term effects of spaceflight outside of leo. we emphasize that the following section mostly presents early evidence and even contradictions due to the current limitations of the human space omics field, and that much more work would be needed in the coming decades to assess the validity of the below preliminary findings and interpretations. drug metabolism in space medical kits onboard the iss contain pharmaceuticals to cover various medical events and emergencies, including injuries, illnesses, infections, sleep disruptions, motion sickness, and cognitive and behavioral health conditions 18. documentation of medication usage has not been consistent, but studies suggest about 94 % of crew members used medications at least once during space shuttle missions 19. despite the common use of medications to manage health concerns on orbit, few studies have explored how to refine pharmaceutical applications in the unique environment of space. preliminary evidence suggests that spaceflight may introduce impurity products, alter the physical appearance, and quicken the degradation of certain drugs before their expiration dates 20, 21. although these investigations have been severely limited without adequate ground controls, they have underlined the need to verify if any spaceflight factors may affect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters that determine the pharmaceutical safety and efficacy, and the mechanisms responsible for these effects 22, 23. these factors might include the space environment itself ( such as chronic low - dose radiation ) and / or confounding extraneous factors ( such as temperature, humidity, and dosage repackaging commonly used to meet the limited volume constraints on space vehicles ) 18, 22, 24. thorough metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
242,PMC11166943,introduction,6,"temperature, humidity, and dosage repackaging commonly used to meet the limited volume constraints on space vehicles ) 18, 22, 24. thorough metadata tabulation could eventually help unravel not only how to preserve drugs in space, but also how to better understand precision responses to such drugs. a recent pharmacogenetics study by the esa demonstrated that allelic variation may influence the safety and effectiveness of how individual crew members metabolize drugs on the iss. researchers examined the 78 standard drugs permanently available on the iss and found that the metabolism of 24 of them was significantly affected by individual variants in genetic polymorphism enzymes 25. this discovery suggested that almost one - third of drugs on the iss may warrant personal dose adjustments or alternative therapies for crew members who have allelic predispositions that can render them anywhere from poor metabolizers ( with decreased drug clearance, increased plasma drug levels, and potential adverse drug response ) to ultra - rapid metabolizers ( with increased drug clearance, decreased plasma drug levels, and potential ineffective drug response ). populations throughout the world can have different frequencies of genetic polymorphism enzymes that affect drug metabolisms 26 ; thus, pharmacogenetic screening of consenting astronauts from diverse backgrounds could better ensure equal representation 27. personal astronaut drug - metabolism profiles could be generated based on the two reaction phases of drug biotransformation. the first drug biotransformation reaction produces a more water - soluble and less active metabolite usually through the hydroxylating enzyme superfamily known as cytochrome p450 ( cyp450 ). this enzyme superfamily is believed to account for 75 % of total drug metabolism 28. indeed, cyps have recently been suggested to be altered in flight due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling 29. several cyp450 genes are highly polymorphic, producing enzyme variants that cause variability in drug - metabolizing effects between groups. during mission planning, cyp450 genetic variant profiles for consenting astronauts could be generated and cross - referenced with mission drug lists to prevent scenarios in which crew members would otherwise metabolize drugs in harmful or inefficient ways 13. the second drug biotransformation is usually a conjugation reaction wherein a small molecule binds to the drug metabolite and increases its solubility for excretion. for this situation, consenting astronauts could assess their pre - mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents ( such as glutat",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
243,PMC11166943,introduction,7,"molecule binds to the drug metabolite and increases its solubility for excretion. for this situation, consenting astronauts could assess their pre - mission status of all nutrient cofactors and conjugation agents ( such as glutathione, glycine, cysteine, arginine, and taurine ) to inform their optimum conditions 13. one concrete example of how cyp allelic variants could inform treatments during space exploration relates to acute radiation sickness ( ars ) 30. ars is an accepted risk on orbit, and common medications to treat its primary symptoms of nausea and vomiting include ondansetron and granisetron, which are both metabolized differently in the liver based on individual cyp genetic polymorphisms. specifically, the cyp2d6 enzyme metabolizes ondansetron, and, hence, groups who are ultra - rapid metabolizers of the cyp2d6 pathway have a higher risk of still vomiting within one day of radiotherapy with ondansetron 31. these groups may benefit from treating ars with granisetron, which is instead metabolized by the cyp3a enzyme 31. another example of how cyp allelic variants could inform spaceflight therapies based on personal predispositions relates to sleep drugs, which are commonly used by crew. in fact, 78 % of shuttle crew reported taking zolpidem and zaleplon, powerful sleep pills, for more than half of the nights of their missions 32. cyp3a polymorphisms are known to affect zolpidem metabolism 33, but not zaleplon metabolism 25, and astronauts could use this knowledge to more safely tailor their sleep - related treatments. it may also be meaningful to investigate optimal doses of medications that are more tailored to the demanding lifestyles of astronauts. for example, unlike many individuals on earth, astronauts on the iss are occasionally awakened by alarms during scheduled sleeping shifts in order to perform emergency tasks that require effective cognitive and psychomotor capabilities 34. a study at nasa johnson space center found that subjects who consumed a higher dose of zolpidem before sleep experienced significantly reduced cognitive and psychomotor performance during emergency awakenings ; however, they found no similar impairments in subjects who consumed the lower dose of zolpidem, the dose of zaleplon, or the placebo before sleep onset 34. hence, even though the approved doses of zolpidem and zaleplon may be fit for",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
244,PMC11166943,introduction,8,"subjects who consumed the lower dose of zolpidem, the dose of zaleplon, or the placebo before sleep onset 34. hence, even though the approved doses of zolpidem and zaleplon may be fit for most terrestrial applications, the unique duties during spaceflight may warrant adjusted recommended dosages of these, and possibly other, approved medications. even the metabolism of medications may be altered in spaceflight compared to on earth. the kidneys, which play a major role in drug excretion, may reduce urine output during weightlessness 35. the liver, which is the main organ that metabolizes drugs and xenobiotics, may also behave differently between terrestrial and spaceflight conditions, although results have been conflicting : while some studies have reported an increase in hepatic blood flow and size during spaceflight 36, other studies have suggested a decrease in hepatic metabolism in space, which may roughly correspond to a decrease in hepatic blood flow due to the hypovolemia that occurs on orbit 37. clear elucidation of potential differences between drug metabolism in terrestrial versus orbital conditions will require further investigation, and any reliable findings could eventually be integrated for improved aerospace healthcare recommendations 27. micronutrient metabolism in space recent studies are elucidating tentative relationships between omics and micronutrient intake that may link to adverse health events in space. one key example of this is one - carbon metabolism, which involves the transfer of methyl groups from donors ( such as folate, b12, choline, and betaine ). we note that many of the donors are essential inputs that must be obtained from the diet. the enzymes that regulate one - carbon metabolism are produced from highly polymorphic methyltransferase genes ; any possible ramifications for human spaceflight are only recently unfolding 13. as an example, spaceflight - associated neuro - ocular syndrome ( sans ) is a unique and distinctive clinical manifestation. it includes optic disk edema ( swelling ), choroidal folds, and focal areas of ischemic retina ( cotton wool spots ). this disease is believed to present in over 20 % of astronauts both during and after short and long duration spaceflight 38. with no known terrestrial analogue, evidence - based countermeasures are only recently emerging ; these include lower body negative pressure and nutritional supplementation 39, the latter of which could be further refined through omics studies. indeed, one research group examined 49 astronauts and discovered that common variations in",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
245,PMC11166943,introduction,9,"- based countermeasures are only recently emerging ; these include lower body negative pressure and nutritional supplementation 39, the latter of which could be further refined through omics studies. indeed, one research group examined 49 astronauts and discovered that common variations in one - carbon metabolism genes, combined with lower levels of vitamins b2, b6, and b9, appeared to be associated with sans 40, 41. in addition to poor neuro - ocular health, disordered one - carbon metabolism may play a role in bone fragility ( with increased osteoclast activation and decreased osteoblast activity ) 13, hypertension ( with increased intraocular pressure ) 42, and chromosome instability ( with concurring folate deficiency increasing defective dna repair ) 43. it is indicative that this single metabolic property may have wide - ranging impacts on some of the more perplexing health complications known to occur during spaceflight 13. for these reasons, one - carbon metabolism is an example candidate for deeper research into a future precision space medicine approach. there is likewise preliminary evidence that prolonged radiation exposure may interact with genetic polymorphisms that alter micronutrient metabolism, predisposing to disease in space. for example, there is precursory evidence suggesting that the space environment partially contributes to altered iron metabolism in astronauts 44. iron overload is believed to occur more often in individuals with allelic variants for hemochromatosis ( hfe ) 45. simultaneously, urinary magnesium ( mg ) levels are reported to decrease during space missions, with a slight majority of post - spaceflight astronauts presenting with levels below minimum clinical guidelines 46. taken together, these provisional observations suggest that astronauts with hfe allelic variants may develop unusually high levels of iron when exposed to the space environment, which may induce oxidative stress and unstable dna 47. given that mg repairs dna damage 48, further research may be justified to examine whether convergent mg deficiencies could complete a dangerous aggregation of risk events in a subset of astronauts who are susceptible to this array of environment, omics, and dietary intake parameters 13. dna stability is a leading human safety concern in space and hence it seems meaningful to investigate whether consenting individuals can benefit from optimizing any essential dietary inputs with relevance to dna repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles. the supplementation of vitamin d, another important micronutrient, is regularly integrated into spaceflight nutrition programs 49. while vitamin d is well - known for its",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
246,PMC11166943,introduction,10,"to dna repair before, during, and after spaceflight based on precision risk profiles. the supplementation of vitamin d, another important micronutrient, is regularly integrated into spaceflight nutrition programs 49. while vitamin d is well - known for its influence on bone production, it impacts several more biological processes, including immune system modulation. its effect on immunity seems to be mediated by the vitamin d receptor ( vdr ), expressed by antigen - presenting cells and activated t cells 50. conversely, vitamin d and vdr are necessary to maintain a healthy number of regulatory t cells 51. allelic variants of the vdr gene appear to be associated with better response to vitamin d supplementation 52, and allelic variants of genes ( such as 7 - dehydrocholesterol reductase ( dhcr7 ), a gene related to sterol metabolism ) are believed to be related to improved vitamin d metabolism and insulin resistance 53. therefore, poor vitamin d status and metabolism of individuals during space missions, which already have inherent stressful elements, might negatively affect the immune systems of astronauts, and this could potentially be mitigated through precision omics profiles. macronutrient metabolism in space differences in macronutrient consumption needs have been linked to variants in genes, such as the retinoic acid receptor beta ( rarb ) gene, the dna damage - regulated autophagy modulator 1 ( dram1 ) gene, and the fat mass and obesity - associated ( fto ) gene 54, 55. altogether, these variants appear to be associated with body composition, fat distribution, and obesity risk in relation to carbohydrate, lipid, and protein intake 54, 55. initial studies have suggested that endocrine changes linked to spaceflight modify metabolism and strengthen its association with alterations in astronaut body composition and nutritional intake needs 56. it may be possible that long - duration space voyages could exacerbate dietary deficits. the nutritional condition of astronauts appears to be affected by metabolic stress, changing gut flora, altered feeding behavior, vitamin insufficiency, and electrolyte imbalance 57. maintaining energy balance in space missions will likely be critical for maintaining body fat muscle homeostasis 58. these early findings imply a possibility that prolonged space exposure and dietary deficits may interact with genetic polymorphisms in a subset of astronauts to promote unusual pathologies that could be prevented by better nutritional information and health plans based on thorough research in the spaceflight omics discipline. it may hence be valuable to properly investigate",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
247,PMC11166943,introduction,11,"deficits may interact with genetic polymorphisms in a subset of astronauts to promote unusual pathologies that could be prevented by better nutritional information and health plans based on thorough research in the spaceflight omics discipline. it may hence be valuable to properly investigate and characterize any relationships between micronutrients, macronutrients, pharmaceuticals, omics, and various spaceflight environmental factors. these relationships are complex and underline the critical usefulness for rigorous standardization of space omics data and metadata so that meta - analyses may one day disentangle more confidently which factors are linked to preventable diseases at both the group and individual levels during spaceflight. standardized space omics collection standardization of space omics data and metadata would be an important component of a successful human space omics discipline. jaxa is currently conducting human liquid biopsy studies on the iss. the main purpose of the studies is to investigate how the space environment affects humans at the tissue level. besides fat and skin samples, which can be risky, whole - body solid tissue biopsies cannot typically be conducted in humans in space. as a result, the project proposes to perform minimally invasive liquid biopsies in astronauts. liquid biopsies can detect cell - free components ( microrna, rna, dna, and extracellular vesicles ) in the blood and scientists can estimate which tissues the cell components are derived from, allowing for full - body monitoring of omics responses. while solid biopsies only reflect a single time point of a single site on a single tissue, liquid biopsies can allow for a less invasive assessment of extracellular dna and rna in the plasma, which can represent molecular responses of the internal tissues in the body and can be obtained at repeated timepoints. the project proposes to collect astronaut blood samples at multiple time points before, during, and after living on the iss. murine and human plasma samples may be processed using the same processing protocol, thereby allowing for direct comparison of human and veterinary patients in a minimally invasive fashion for both species. these unique data collections are expected to enable cross - species integrative data analysis of space environment effects on mammals in a manner that is less technically and ethically complex than previous methods. moving forward, the majority of sampling on astronauts would likely consist of liquid biopsy approaches and other non - invasive and minimally invasive procedures. traditional tissue biopsies carry a risk of infection and localized pain which could compromise astronaut health and performance in physical tasks such as spacewalks. furthermore, less invasive sampling methods are",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
248,PMC11166943,introduction,12,"biopsy approaches and other non - invasive and minimally invasive procedures. traditional tissue biopsies carry a risk of infection and localized pain which could compromise astronaut health and performance in physical tasks such as spacewalks. furthermore, less invasive sampling methods are often quick to perform and do not require significant recovery periods between samples, which can allow for more frequent sampling and thus greater temporal resolution of omic changes throughout missions. the feasibility of orbital sampling and readout can be explored for various biological sources, such as saliva, sweat, tears, urine, and nasal discharge, some of which have been reviewed in the context of human spaceflight elsewhere 59. an increase in capabilities for inflight omic processing and readout could also enable inflight interventions to maintain health, such as nutritional supplements based on gene regulatory changes related to metabolism of specific vitamins. new metadata normalization is another example of a rising standardization challenge that comes with the arrival of human space omics projects. some key metadata parameters that should be collected from humans include environment, diet, nutrition, psychosocial dynamics, lifestyle, medical history, anthropometrics, and phenotypes 13. many of these metadata parameters have not been necessarily collected in space and hence have no standardization methods. for instance, wearable technology could be implemented to provide metadata of astronaut health, similar to fitness trackers that have been successfully used on earth to measure various medical parameters, including increased insulin resistance, which has also been observed in spaceflight 60, 61. at the same time, metadata can be misused to identify individual astronauts, an ethical problem that, unlike in model organism studies, has to be addressed. with a mission to continuously improve recommended metadata normalization protocols for space omics data, issop may help spark discussions needed to resolve some of these challenges. in addition to best efforts to standardize space omics studies 62, increased resolution may help interpret allelic variants associated with disease risks by more precisely pinpointing cell types and states involved in biology. achieving this goal relates back to our project exploring an example set of alleles that are putatively linked to protective mechanisms, and their implications for therapeutic compound discovery and improved spaceflight nutrition and lifestyle recommendations 63. as described next, extending standardized approaches toward space omics data that is higher in resolution could enable the generation of cell space atlases, which could further push forward a developing field of precision space healthcare. human cell space atlas to date, bulk transcriptomic technologies, such as rna - sequencing ( rna - seq ) and",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024

253,PMC11166943,introduction,17,"barrier to the development and deployment of emerging space - based health technologies, including precision healthcare. thus, in the following section, we consider legal and ethical challenges pertaining to policymaking in this context, concluding with some thoughts on how best to achieve balanced policies which support space omics research while protecting the rights of the participants ( fig. 3 ). ethical considerations of human omics research is an emerging area for spaceflight 79, 80, 59, this is just part of the bigger picture of space ethics 81, and human omics research on earth 82. fig. 3 ethics. policies pertaining to the collection, storage, and usage of omics data from consenting astronauts and spaceflight participants would need to be carefully balanced. thorough discussion amongst international ethicists could ensure that such policies are designed such that they are not so restrictive that they significantly limit the potential for scientific progress and improved occupational healthcare in space, and not so permissible that they expose participants to ethical harms. dangers of restrictive policies : scientific potential unused as mentioned throughout this manuscript, standardized collection and curation of human space omics data has great potential to accelerate scientific research into human health in space and enable the deployment of precision medicine technologies to improve occupational healthcare during spaceflight missions. therefore, underutilization of the scientific and healthcare potential for human space omics data is the primary danger of overly restrictive policies. firstly, if policies restrict the operational usage of human space omics data in occupational health processes, such as countermeasure design and long - term health monitoring, the full potential for reducing health risks might not be realized. consequently, this could endanger crew members, reduce likelihood of mission success, and potentially infringe upon the duty of care space agencies have for their astronaut employees. this duty of care includes not just the immediate health and safety of astronauts during missions, but also their long - term health due to occupational exposures such as cosmic radiation 78. secondly, if policies do not allow for sufficient data to be collected and processed from humans in space for research purposes, the pace of space life sciences research will be slower, with increased dependency on ground - based analogs. similarly, restrictive policies for data accessibility / sharing would also slow the pace of research. when investigators contribute data to the scientific community through open - science initiatives, it can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. in the context of spaceflight omics data, the value of open - science has recently been demonstrated through a large - scale multi - om",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
254,PMC11166943,introduction,18,"initiatives, it can be analyzed via varied approaches, including comparatively to other datasets to yield novel insights. in the context of spaceflight omics data, the value of open - science has recently been demonstrated through a large - scale multi - omics analysis comparing datasets from the nasa genelab biorepository, to uncover mitochondrial dysregulation as a key hub of the biological response to spaceflight 83. biorepositories can be leveraged with “ big data ” approaches, where patterns such as radiation sensitivity, can be learned via the application of machine learning methods to collections of multi - omics datasets 84. with increased collection of omics data from humans in space, these kinds of approaches could be applied to human spaceflight, such as to predict susceptibility to radiation - based health issues in individual crewmembers 85. limiting accessibility to human space omics data creates a barrier to analysis efforts, thus every decrement from complete open access reduces the scientific utility of the data. a final consequence of restrictive policies is reductions in the scope and precision of the data provided to the wider scientific community. for the nasa twins study, authors of one follow - up paper that accessed and reanalyzed the original study data indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ), indels, copy number variations ( cnvs ), and structural genomic elements could not be included in the publication for confidentiality purposes 86, thus limiting the scope of their public facing analysis. regarding precision, efforts to anonymize and sanitize the data prior to data sharing - including data aggregation approaches and withholding metadata - could reduce the scientific utility, particularly as individual differences, such as gene variants associated with susceptibility to health issues, are essential information for unlocking precision healthcare approaches 63. dangers of permissible policies : exposure to ethical harms on the other hand, while scientific utilization of human space omics data could reduce health risks for crews, if policies are overly permissible, omics research could also lead to harm by exposing human subjects to ethical issues. in the case of space agencies, this would also infringe on their duty of care to their astronaut employees. due to the familial nature of genomics, these issues may also affect family members. notably, compared to typical terrestrial cohorts, many of these ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population ; astronauts are easily identifiable due to their current ra",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
255,PMC11166943,introduction,19,"nature of genomics, these issues may also affect family members. notably, compared to typical terrestrial cohorts, many of these ethical challenges are amplified by the unique nature of the spacefaring population ; astronauts are easily identifiable due to their current rarity and status as public figures 79. one ethical issue that is particularly amplified by the standing of astronauts is that of privacy. the term “ genetic privacy ” is used ubiquitously, yet privacy breaches could apply to any identifiable omic - based personal data. privacy breaches would involve disclosure of this data against the will of the participants, which could lead to psychological harm. specifically, policies may be considered overly permissible if they fail to account for the risks of identifiability from the full range of omic data types and data formats. it is well understood that individuals can be identified using genomics data, such as snps 87. however, identification via other omic data types, such as transcriptomics 88, proteomics 89, 90, microbiomics 91, and combinations of omic types ( multi - omics ) 92, is a developing area of the literature. identifying specific participants becomes possible through “ linkage attacks ” when phenotypic information is available in addition to the omics data 88. due to the nature of astronauts as public figures, phenotypic information such as ethnicity, age, and biological sex is readily available to the public. the small population size also means that the number of possible matches is limited, increasing the likelihood of successful linkage attacks. aside from linkage attacks, privacy may also be violated via attacks on the data storage system. thus, policies may be considered overly permissible if they do not ensure appropriate security and safeguarding mechanisms against data breaches. relating to the issue of privacy is the ethical issue of genetic discrimination, which refers to individuals receiving differential or unfair treatment based on their genetic data. policies permitting space agencies to use omics data predictive of health issues, such as genetic variants, in astronaut selection or during processes such as flight assignment, could be seen as discriminatory. indeed, many countries worldwide have enacted laws to prevent the use of genetic information in employment decisions 93. it is worth noting that this is somewhat of a controversial and complex topic ; for example, in the united states, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions, such as to withhold deploying troops with g6pd deficiency to locations which would require them to take antimalarial drugs, since doing so can",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024
256,PMC11166943,introduction,20,", in the united states, the military can use routine genetic screening results to inform assignment decisions, such as to withhold deploying troops with g6pd deficiency to locations which would require them to take antimalarial drugs, since doing so can cause life - threatening hemolytic reactions 94. while the united states space force could present an interesting exception, nasa is not a branch of the military, so it is subject to the genetic information nondiscrimination act 2008 ( gina ), and therefore it would seem that it cannot use omic information in assignment and employment decisions 79, which is also aligned with the current nasa policy ( npd 7170. 1 ). however, even with precision medicine approaches, sending an individual with a genetic predisposition to spaceflight - associated risks, such as radiation susceptibility, on a long - duration mission to mars may still increase the likelihood of a serious medical incident. thus, it has been suggested that omic information would be useful for spaceflight selection and assignment processes 95. this presents an ethical dilemma, where on the one hand, using omic information for flight assignment without the individual ’ s consent could be seen as discriminatory, and on the other hand, not doing so could potentially endanger the crew and reduce likelihood of mission safety and success. an additional consideration here is that some spaceflight - relevant genetic mutations may be linked to certain populations on earth, which raises further issues of equity 63. using omics for precision healthcare does appear to be supported under the current nasa policy and gina 80, and this could hopefully decrease health risks associated with individual differences during spaceflight missions to an acceptable level, while refraining from using omics information for employment selection and flight assignment. altogether, this balance may align with what is perhaps the current consensus for an appropriate compromise, based on regulations in many regions worldwide. one further ethical issue that will be faced by space agencies and commercial spaceflight companies collecting astronaut omics is the risk of incidental findings 80. for example, collection and analysis of astronaut omics data could reveal unexpected findings, such as predisposition to late onset alzheimer ’ s disease. in some cases, these findings may not be medically actionable. disclosing these findings to the astronaut could cause them and their family members psychological harm. policies would be seen as overly permissible if they do not factor in the risk of incidental findings and fail to implement appropriate and clear procedures for disclosure and genetic counseling. keys to developing balanced policies ultimately, policymaking for",Astronaut omics and the impact of space on the human body at scale,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11166943/,Orbit,2024

367,PMC11167039,introduction,0,"introduction mitigating the adverse effects of spaceflight requires a better mechanistic understanding of the profound challenges that are imposed upon astronauts, including the upcoming missions to mars and the moon. extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the earth ’ s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. the microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness 1 – 4. mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading - induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue 4 – 8. therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of nasa ’ s long - term mission objectives. skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading 9, 10. indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy - sensing environments 11 – 15. load - bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. for example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers 16, 17. in response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross - sectional area 4, 6. a common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein 18 – 20. however, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity 21, disuse 22, cancer 23, and aging 24 compromises physical function and systemic health. rotating wall vessel bioreactors are frequently utilized in tissue engineering and cell culture",Bioreactor development for skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy by manipulating uniaxial cyclic strain: proof of concept,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11167039/,Orbit,2024

449,PMC11833055,introduction,0,"introduction space exploration is a long - term dream and pursuit of humanity, and it is also one of the important fields of technological development. in long - term space flight, astronauts face many problems. one of them is the reduction of gravitational force. terrestrial life has evolved under the influence of gravity for millions of years, and long - term microgravity represents unusual stress experiences that can cause physiological and morphological changes 1. numerous studies have shown that long - term weightlessness can lead to various physiological and pathological changes, such as the skeletal and muscular system, cardiovascular system, immune system, and nervous system 2. prolonged exposure to microgravity during extended space missions poses various physiological challenges to astronauts, necessitating thorough research into the effects of microgravity on the human body. one of the crucial issues is the impact of long - term spaceflight on brain function. studies have shown that astronauts experience changes such as ataxia, posture disorders, perceptual illusions, fatigue, and cognitive impairment 3. the high cost and technical issues related to spaceflight have stimulated the development of ground models that reasonably simulate the effects of space flight. currently, tail - suspension hindlimb unloading is the most classic and widely used model, particularly those affecting the musculoskeletal system 4. however, this model has certain limitations, that is, it can only be applied locally, and cannot be applied to the whole experimental animal. besides, there are physiological differences between hindlimb unloading models and spaceflight, especially in terms of somatosensory input, spatial orientation, and vestibular disruption 5. three - dimensional ( 3d ) clinostat is a device that generates multi - directional g forces. by controlling the rotation on both axes, it can offset the cumulative gravity vector at the center of the device 6. previous studies have shown that 3d clinostat have been widely used on plants, cells and caenorhabditis elegans to simulate microgravity effects 7 – 9. our previous studies suggest that the central nervous system probably changed in mice trained with 3d clinostat 10. therefore, the aim of our work is to systematically assess 3d clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice by behavioral and multi group analysis, focusing on the changes in central nervous system and cognitive function.",Behavioral and multiomics analysis of 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice focusing on the central nervous system,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11833055/,Orbit,2025

474,PMC11833055,discussion,0,"discussion this study explored the impact of simulated microgravity effect using a 3d clinostat on mice, with a particular focus on behavioral, metabolic, gut microbiome and brain transcriptome changes. our findings revealed that the simulated microgravity effect induced by the 3d clinostat triggered noteworthy transformations within the central nervous system. this model has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for investigating cognitive changes associated with microgravity environments, while also offering new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying spaceflight - related health risks. in this study, the behavioral experiments demonstrated that the 3d clinostat had a significant impact on the physical activity and exploratory behavior. the observed reduction in movement distance and exercise time in the open field test, combined with similar findings in the y maze, elevated plus maze, and novel object recognition tests, suggests a marked decrease in the overall motivation and exploratory drive. these results are consistent with existing literature on the effects of microgravity, where diminished activity levels and altered behavioral patterns have been reported 19 – 21. for instance, mice displayed similar declines in exploratory behavior after a 30 - day spaceflight on bion - m1 satellite 21. different from past results, we did not find obvious anxiety or depression in mice 20, 22, 23. it is known that chronic restraint can lead to anxiety and depression 24. we speculate that the anxiety or depression emotion of animals found in the hu model might be caused by tail suspension and restraint, rather than the direct effect of microgravity. the absence of notable disparities in learning and memory between the cs and sb groups, as assessed by the morris water maze and other memory related tests, might initially seem surprising. one would expect that the reduced physical activity and altered emotional states might extend to cognitive functions. however, the results suggest that the impact of microgravity on cognition might be more complex, potentially involving compensatory mechanisms that preserve cognitive abilities despite changes in other behavioral domains. this finding aligns with studies in which astronauts, despite experiencing emotional and physical stressors, often maintain cognitive performance during space missions, possibly due to intensive training and adaptation processes 25. in fact, there are indeed some controversies about the effects of microgravity on cognitive function 25 – 27. during spaceflights, the overall cognitive performance of astronauts does not show significant decline, but their cognitive function declines notably after returning to earth 25. wollseiffen et al. found that neurocognitive performance can even be improved during",Behavioral and multiomics analysis of 3D clinostat simulated microgravity effect in mice focusing on the central nervous system,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11833055/,Orbit,2025

537,PMC11940681,abstract,0,"exposure to weightlessness in microgravity and elevated space radiation are associated with rapid bone loss in mammals, but questions remain about their mechanisms of action and relative importance. in this study, we tested the hypothesis that bone loss during spaceflight in low earth orbit is primarily associated with site - specific microgravity unloading of weight - bearing sites in the skeleton. microcomputed tomography and histological analyses of bones from mice space flown on iss for 37 days in the nasa rodent research - 1 experiment show significant site - specific cancellous and cortical bone loss occurring in the femur, but not in l2 vertebrae. the lack of bone degenerative effects in the spine in combination with same - animal paired losses in the femur suggests that space radiation levels in low earth orbit or other systemic stresses are not likely to significantly contribute to the observed bone loss. remarkably, spaceflight is also associated with accelerated progression of femoral head endochondral ossification. this suggests the microgravity environment promotes premature progression of secondary ossification during late stages of skeletal maturation at 21 weeks. furthermore, mice housed in the nasa iss rodent habitat during 1 g ground controls maintained or gained bone relative to mice housed in standard vivarium cages that showed significant bone mass declines. these findings suggest that housing in the rodent habitat with greater topological enrichment from 3d wire - mesh surfaces may promote increased mechanical loading of weight - bearing bones and maintenance of bone mass. in summary, our results indicate that in female mice approaching skeletal maturity, mechanical unloading of weight - bearing sites is the major cause of bone loss in microgravity, while sites loaded predominantly by muscle activity, such as the spine, appear unaffected. additionally, we identified early - onset of femoral head epiphyseal plate secondary ossification as a novel spaceflight skeletal unloading effect that may lead to premature long bone growth arrest in microgravity.",37-Day microgravity exposure in 16-Week female C57BL/6J mice is associated with bone loss specific to weight-bearing skeletal sites,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11940681/,Orbit,2025
538,PMC11940681,introduction,0,"introduction understanding the effects of the spaceflight environment on biological systems is an important area of research because of health concerns associated with increased human spaceflight activities in low earth orbit ( leo ) and in future deep space exploration of the moon and mars. our research focuses on the skeletal bone loss observed in mammalian rodent models in response to microgravity and space radiation, including their mechanisms of action, and their relative contributions to altered skeletal homeostasis. rigorously investigating the effects of spaceflight on bone, however, has proven to be complex because of highly variable space experiments conditions, plus technical, logistic and other limitations on the ability to control and replicate those experiments. as a result, reports of spaceflight effects on bone vary ; findings range from increases in mandibular bone volume to both significant and nonsignificant changes in tibial trabeculae and various cortical sites [ 1 – 8 ]. similarly, meta - analyses of spaceflight bone loss across species show variable site - specificity and magnitudes [ 9, 10 ] of bone structural parameters. the nasa rodent research validation mission ( rr - 1 ) introduced the nasa rh as an iss national lab facility for rodent studies in order to standardize discrepancies between spaceflight studies ( fig 1a ). importantly for experiment design, animals can also be euthanized and dissected on orbit, avoiding potential concerns about hypergravity exposure during spacecraft reentry in live animal return experiments. the rr - 1 experiment included ground - based controls in the rh, baseline controls to account for effects of aging over the 37 - day study, and vivarium controls to reference results to standard vivarium cage mouse housing [ 11, 12 ] ( fig 1b ). in our investigation of rr - 1 bone tissue samples, we focused on the hindlimb and the spine to compare sites of the skeleton predominantly loaded by weight - bearing and muscle activity, respectively ( fig 1c ). the experiment used mice during the late stages of skeletal maturation, that occur between 16 and 21 weeks of age, prior to onset of femoral growth plate closure and secondary endochondral ossification ( seo ) [ 13 ]. 10. 1371 / journal. pone. 0317307. g001 fig 1 ( a ) image of the rh used in the ground control and spaceflight conditions ( credit dominic hart, nasa ).

563,PMC12021249,introduction,0,"introduction nematodes of the genus caenorhabditis are an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. the most studied organism of this group is caenorhabditis elegans, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost - effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [ 1 ]. c. elegans develop through four morphologically distinct larval stages ( l1 - l4 ), before progressing into adults. most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. high - throughput assays such as rna sequencing, genome - wide association studies ( gwas ), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. the standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into l1 larvae that are arrested when starved. the synchronous population of l1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite ( bleach ) solution ( fig 1 ). however, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [ 2 ]. to control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high - throughput assays, making the process time - consuming [ 3 – 5 ]. 10. 1371 / journal. pone. 0318143. g001 fig 1 comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos. bleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. filtration involves using size - specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. the figure was created using biorender. to overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [ 6, 7 ]. such devices enable precise control of parameters such as",Development of a size-separation technique to isolate Caenorhabditis elegans embryos using mesh filters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12021249/,Orbit,2025

( 2023 ) who studied three commonly employed methods. these were two - arm matching, one - arm pointing and one - arm repositioning. somewhat unexpectedly, each method produced a significantly different outcome. this led to the question, do we have more than one position sense? we have maintained a continuing interest in position sense over the years and, more recently, become aware that under conditions of weightlessness position sense is disturbed ( young et al. 1984 ; kenyon and young 1986 ; weber et al. 2020 ). it has led us to speculate about possible mechanisms responsible for the disturbance ( weber and proske 2022 ; proske and weber 2023 ). in the light of the findings by roach et al. ( 2023 ) we have decided to re - measure position sense during changes in gravity with each of the three methods and to look for differences in outcomes. here we were hoping to obtain new insight into the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of position sense. arguably the most influential study of the effects of changes in gravity on position sense is that by lackner and dizio ( 1992 ). position sense was measured, using a two - arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in gravity during parabolic flight. however, rather than studying position sense directly, the authors made observations on the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response to muscle vibration ( goodwin et al. 1972 ). the method has the advantage of producing large changes in position sense for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied. other reports on position sense in microgravity were those of bock ( 1994 ) and bringoux et al.

( 2012 ). they showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. adding gravity - like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants ’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. the authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. we have considered the possibility that the normal position signal, especially near the flexion or extension limits of a joint ’ s working range, was likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors ( proske 2023 ). in hypergravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the position signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense values above those for 1g levels. similarly, a fall in joint torque would lower the joint receptor component and therefore reduce position sense values below 1g values. with this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values using the three methods and asked the question, were all three similarly affected by the changes in gravity? in the present study we have chosen to measure position sense directly, rather than as a vibration illusion. in view of the findings of roach et al. ( 2023 ), we have considered the possibility of the existence of more than one position sense ( weber and proske 2022 ). it has led us to re - examine the question of the effects of weightlessness on position sense, more broadly. participants were asked to measure position sense with each of the three methods, during periods of high and low gravity generated during a series of parabolic flights. the aim was to try to confirm, during periods of high and low gravity, the disturbance of position sense, measured with each method.",Disturbances in human position sense during alterations in gravity: a parabolic flight experiment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,Orbit,2025

578,PMC12031868,discussion,0,"discussion when we embarked on the present study, it was to ask the question, did gravity influence position sense, no matter what method of measurement was used ( weber and proske 2022 )? the present study has shown that for position sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in gravity had significant effects on the measured values. for repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values were unresponsive to changes in gravity. given these differences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the importance of declaring the method used whenever position sense is measured, both at ground level and under conditions of weightlessness. our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing. in roach et al. ( 2023 ), before each measurement, elbow muscles were conditioned in such a way that it brought out a thixotropic pattern in the distribution of the position errors. since muscle spindles are the only known sensory receptors to exhibit thixotropy ( proske et al. 1993 ), such patterns were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in generation of the position signals. there was evidence of spindle participation in position sense measured with two - arm matching and one - arm pointing, while for repositioning the evidence was weak. such an outcome reflected a similar pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study. it tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that gravity effects could be revealed as well. it was as though in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were linked in some way with the participation of spindles. that conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key role in the observed gravity - dependent changes in position sense. in the present study, for matching and pointing there were increases in errors in hypergravity and decreases in microgravity. what might that mean? as mentioned, it is believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal during movements about a joint ; an increase in spindle discharge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended joint ( matthews 1988 ). we suggest that there is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development ( held and bauer 1967 ). if, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this",Disturbances in human position sense during alterations in gravity: a parabolic flight experiment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,Orbit,2025
579,PMC12031868,discussion,1,"1988 ). we suggest that there is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development ( held and bauer 1967 ). if, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. since the reference remains fixed at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher than expected from 1g values. the indicator would move towards the position of the reference, until a point was reached where the signals from the two arms matched. for elbow flexors this would be a position where the indicator arm was more extended than the reference. if spindle discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for elbow extension below those for 1g levels. this argument does not consider the spindle signals in the antagonist extensors. presumably, in real life, it is the effect of gravity on the balance of discharges in flexors and extensors which determines the direction of the errors. however, in the present study, all of the errors for matching and pointing were in the direction of elbow extension ( fig. 4 ), including the values in normal gravity, suggesting that the signal coming from the flexors dominated the outcome. it could be argued that the smaller errors in microgravity represented a more accurate measurement and not be a disturbance at all. we propose that whenever the prevailing spindle discharge rates are altered, up or down, away from their normal 1g level, this should be seen as a disturbance. these gravity - dependent alterations in the spindle rate : joint angle relation lead the participant to perceive their arms in positions which are unexpected and therefore makes them unsure of the reliability of their movements when these are made in the absence of vision. here it should, perhaps, be remembered that there is some evidence for gravity - based influences acting on position sense measured at ground level, under 1g conditions. when participants were asked to judge elbow position with respect to the vertical, they performed better than when asked to focus on joint angles ( soechting 1982 ). why should spindle discharges increase or decrease during gravity changes? in an arm reaching task it was shown by bringoux et al. ( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. adding gravity - like torque,",Disturbances in human position sense during alterations in gravity: a parabolic flight experiment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,Orbit,2025

( 2012 ) that during parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. adding gravity - like torque, by means of elastic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the movement, recovered participants ’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. the authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. one possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor activity required to overcome the additional torque generated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co - activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges. we have suggested an alternate explanation. the normal position signal, especially when generated near the flexion or extension limits of a joint ’ s working range, is likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors ( proske 2023 ; proske and weber 2023 ). joint receptors have an “ activation angle ” where they begin to generate a maintained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15° - 20° short of the limit of movement at the joint. therefore, when a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and activated joint receptors. the details have been spelt out in proske ( 2024a ). when hypergravity imposes extra torque on the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportunity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component of the position signal. in microgravity, if the arm becomes weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and, as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering the position signal. stretching elastic straps across the joint would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor component of the position signal. that, in turn, would recover position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. to further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint. there is an interesting report by motanova et al.

( 2022 ) describing construction of a “ penguin axial loading suit ” for use in microgravity conditions. the purpose of the suit was to create axial load, to help compensate for the lack of proprioceptive afferent feedback in microgravity. the suit incorporates a system of inbuilt elastic elements which are distributed according to the demands of selected antagonist muscle groups. the ideas underlying construction of such a suit support our joint receptor hypothesis. in the present study, for pointing, the error values were significantly larger than for matching ( fig. 4 ). not only were values larger during changes in gravity, but control errors at 1g were larger as well. a similar trend in the distribution of pointing errors was observed by roach et al. ( 2023 ). it suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of pointing errors. one possible explanation is that for pointing the proprioceptive information coming from the hidden reference arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to guide the pointing arm. such a conversion comes with additional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive measurement ( darling et al. 2024 ). we suggest that such an offset was present in the parabolic measurements. a detailed explanation for the size and direction of the offset remains elusive. the question arises, do frame of reference considerations also apply to two - arm matching? here we have always assumed that both arms were in the same postural frame of reference ( velay et al. 1989 ). certainly, the instructions to the participants were always to align the position of one arm with that of the other arm and no reference was made to gravity. evidence in support of two - arm matching operating within a single frame of reference is the symmetrical distribution of thixotropic errors in both arms ( roach et al. 2023 ). from another point of view, two - arm matching is considered a low - level judgement, made within a single frame of reference ( heroux et al., 2022 ). the findings for repositioning were rather different from those for matching and pointing. the errors were all rather small and there was no significant difference between position sense values during changes in gravity. our original working hypothesis for repositioning had been that when a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle was stored in memory. subsequently, when the participant was asked to reposition the arm, the spin",Disturbances in human position sense during alterations in gravity: a parabolic flight experiment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,Orbit,2025
582,PMC12031868,discussion,4,"hypothesis for repositioning had been that when a participant was asked to remember a chosen angle, the spindle discharge generated in arm muscles at that angle was stored in memory. subsequently, when the participant was asked to reposition the arm, the spindle discharge for that angle was retrieved from memory and compared with the ongoing level of activity, as the arm moved towards the remembered angle, until the two matched. however, such an explanation turned out to be wrong! the data of roach et al. ( 2023 ) suggested that in repositioning ongoing spindle activity did not play a significant role. it raised the possibility that in generating the position signal the necessary information was likely derived from central sources ( proske 2024b ). in support of that view, roach et al. ( 2023 ) did an additional experiment where they introduced thixotropic disturbances after the memorizing stage and before the reproduction stage. the data showed that this did not alter repositioning errors. if spindles had been involved, it should have led to increases in position errors. while we cannot rule out participation of sensory receptors other than spindles in the repositioning process, our current preferred interpretation is that position information in repositioning was largely derived from central sources ( proske 2024b ). the observations made in the present experiments support the view that in repositioning there was no direct involvement of spindles. despite the significant changes in gravity - dependent errors in matching and pointing, presumably mediated by changes in spindle afferent activity, for repositioning, errors in both hypergravity and microgravity remained non - significant. furthermore, for repositioning, even the value during normal gravity was lower than for pointing. we conclude that of the three methods, repositioning was the most accurate and position sense values remained unresponsive to changes in gravity, suggesting that spindles played no role in this sense. presumably, repositioning values were generated entirely centrally. in the future, we want to confirm this conclusion by repeating the repositioning experiment, but carry out the memorizing and repositioning stages in different gravity phases. we suggest that the instruction to the participant, “ remember this angle ”, leads them to focus their attention on the position of the arm, which immediately provides them with the precise angular information for that position. a memory is triggered, expressed in terms of angles of joints and lengths of muscles, but which, at the time of measurement, does not involve any ongoing spindle",Disturbances in human position sense during alterations in gravity: a parabolic flight experiment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12031868/,Orbit,2025

[ 29 ] ). lycopene is a fat - soluble carotenoid, and studies demonstrate that its bioactivity may be enhanced by simultaneous consumption of fat or by heat processing. this study also focused on gene expression in normal prostate tissue in men with low - burden disease. chen et al. focused on circulating and tissue dna oxidative damage and was conducted among men who were surgical candidates who may have had slightly higher risk disease [ 29 ]. additionally, our study focused on changes in the normal prostate microenvironment ; it is possible that these nutrients may have greater effects on the tumor gene expression that were not assessed ( i. e., less than one - third of biopsy samples had sufficient tumor tissue available for analysis ). the 3 - month intervention might also have been too short a duration to observe biologic effects in the prostate, although other studies with short nutritional interventions in men with prostate cancer have detected gene expression changes [ 29, 43, 44 ] including one conducted by our collaborative group in a similar population focused on a comprehensive diet and lifestyle intervention [ 9 ]. these results do not rule out other potential important antitumor effects ( e. g., antioxidant effects ) of lycopene or fish oil, which are not modulated via","Nutritional supplements, COX-2 and IGF-1 expression in men on active surveillance for prostate cancer",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002170/,Orbit,2010

635,PMC3630201,introduction,0,"introduction on earth, at 1 g, mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. conversely, during spaceflight, gravity - generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity - induced mechanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [ 1 ], [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], [ 6 ] and muscle mass [ 7 ], [ 8 ], [ 9 ], [ 10 ], and alterations in cardiovascular function [ 11 ], [ 12 ], [ 13 ], [ 14 ]. because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short - term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long - term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. however, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects. alternatively, it is also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and reach a new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance under reduced mechanical load conditions. since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long - term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano - stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differentiation of tissue - specific adult stem cells. this in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. specifically for bone tissue, short - duration exposure to microgravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [ 15 ], [ 16 ], [ 17 ], [ 18 ], [ 19 ]. this is illustrated by a 1 – 2 % loss of skeletal mineral in weight - bearing bones per month [ 17 ], which poses significant risks for long - duration and interplanetary missions. because bone remodeling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [ 20 ], [ 21 ], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [ 17 ], [ 18 ],","Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,Orbit,2013
636,PMC3630201,introduction,1,", [ 21 ], uncoupling of these processes in microgravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [ 17 ], [ 18 ], [ 22 ], [ 23 ]. increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [ 1 ], [ 17 ] and may be reduced after a period of transition and adaptation to microgravity. however, of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats [ 24 ], [ 25 ], [ 26 ], although, this result has not been reproduced. in skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important long - term factor in spaceflight. short of conducting long - term experiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short - term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long - term degenerative effects of microgravity. to perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the tumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor, cdkn1a / p21. p53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb - unloaded animals [ 27 ], potentially leading to cell cycle arrest and / or apoptosis. furthermore, p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb - unloading [ 28 ] and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting a role for the p53 - signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [ 29 ], [ 30 ]. more remarkably, the cdkn1a / p21 knockout mouse has a viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re - growth, otherwise unheard of in adult mammals [ 31 ]. cdkn1a / p21 can be activated by environmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or be part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell differentiation. this phenotype suggests cdkn1a / p21 up - regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space. recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally","Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,Orbit,2013
637,PMC3630201,introduction,2,"mechanisms during cell differentiation. this phenotype suggests cdkn1a / p21 up - regulation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space. recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the mineralized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in osteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium homeostasis [ 32 ], [ 33 ]. results from light and electron microscopy of rat bone in a 22 - day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977 indicated the appearance of lacunae changed to a “ wide ” morphology that could contribute to bone loss in space [ 34 ]. recently, it was found that osteocytes acquired a more rounded shape after 91 - days in microgravity during the mice drawer system experiment on iss, albeit no statistical significance was obtained due to low n, and the authors did not conclude that osteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring [ 35 ]. on the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for 4 weeks [ 36 ], leaving the potential role and importance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open question. to address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the initial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. we hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in microgravity. finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechanostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degenerative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis.","Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,Orbit,2013

662,PMC3630201,discussion,0,"discussion in this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16 - week - old c57bl / 6j female mice. although data in this field is not extensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast - mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space. we first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss in our microgravity model system. our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis ( fig. 1a ) lost 6. 3 % ( p = 0. 005 ) bone volume fraction and 11. 9 % ( p = 0. 002 ) in bone thickness ( table 1 ) with an accompanying reduction in trabecular bridges between ischial surfaces ( fig. 1e – g ). in addition, bone loss was accompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers ( 197 % ) and osteoclast - covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the femoral head ( 154 % ) ( fig. 3a – d ). this observed initial ( 15 - day ) rate of bone loss, translated to approximately 12 % – 24 % loss per month, is high compared to established long - term astronaut bone loss values of 1 – 2 % per month. the high - levels of osteoclastic activity we observed may, however, subside after the initial transition to microgravity. on earth at 1 g, patients with tetraplegia show an initial phase of pronounced cancellous bone loss, up to 30 %, that subsides one - year post onset of paralysis [ 37 ]. bed rest also results in increased osteoclast activity within 24 h of immobilization [ 38 ], and 120 d bed rest causes increased bone resorption surfaces in the pelvis by osteoclasts [ 39 ]. after this initial phase of osteoclastic resorption in patients, cortical bone loss continues, although at a reduced rate that is medically more manageable. if oste","Microgravity Induces Pelvic Bone Loss through Osteoclastic Activity, Osteocytic Osteolysis, and Osteoblastic Cell Cycle Inhibition by CDKN1a/p21",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3630201/,Orbit,2013

681,PMC3982735,abstract,0,"in the epidermis of arabidopsis leaves, flavonols specifically accumulate in guard cells with enhanced synthesis in the presence of ethylene, where they lower the levels of reactive oxygen species and reduce the rate of stomatal closure. guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. the hormone abscisic acid ( aba ) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species ( ros ). ros accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants ; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. flavonols accumulate in guard cells of arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonol - specific dye. the expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of chalcone synthase, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell - specific flavonoid synthesis. increased levels of ros were detected using a fluorescent ros sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4 - 2, which has a null mutation in chalcone synthase and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. guard cells of transparent testa4 - 2 show more rapid aba - induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the aba - dependent ros burst that drives stomatal closing. the levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene - insensitive2 - 5 mutant. in addition, in both ethylene - overproducing1 and ethylene - treated wild - type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ros and slower aba - mediated stomatal closure. these results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ros accumulation and decreasing the rate of aba - dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene - induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.","Ethylene-Induced Flavonol Accumulation in Guard Cells Suppresses Reactive

690,PMC4321547,introduction,0,"introduction polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including arabidopsis thaliana ( shevyakova et al., 2001 ; knott et al., 2007 ). polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins ( bagni and tassoni, 2001 ). both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules ( for a review, see hussain et al., 2011 ). polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth ( cuevas et al., 2008 ; alet et al., 2011 ; wang et al., 2011 ). polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions ( liu et al., 2000 ; takahashi et al., 2003 ; tang and newton, 2005 ). they may also function as signals that regulate cross - talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses ( obata and fernie, 2012 ). though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces h 2 o 2 ( tisi et al., 2011 ). although it is toxic, h 2 o 2 also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses ( neill, 2002 ). to balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled. five potential arabidopsis polyamine uptake transporter ( put ) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters in leishmania major and trympanosoma cruzi ( mulangi et al., 2012 a, b ). when expressed in the polyamine uptake - deficient δagp2 saccharomyces ce","Natural variation in the expression of ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine in Arabidopsis

721,PMC4490751,discussion,0,"discussion to better understand the mechanisms underlying radiation - induced stimulation of bone resorption, we investigated molecular signals within the latency period between radiation exposure and the manifestation of cancellous tissue loss. in summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy - ion radiation increased gene expression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, rankl, as well as other pro - osteoclast cytokines ( mcp1, tnf, il6 ) ; this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. these findings do not distinguish between changes in gene expression levels due to a shift in the cell population expressing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. in fact, after exposure to radiation of sufficient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell viability and increases in marrow macrophages, which are likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts. therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mrna levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis. radiation - induced changes in cytokine expression were temporally related to changes in several indices of bone resorption, including gene expression ( ctk, acp5, nfatc1 ) and a serum biomarker ( tracp 5b levels ). in addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast - related genes. these data indicate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteoclast formation was temporally associated in response to radiation exposure. our previous work showed radiation - induced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after exposure ( kondo and others 2010 ). taken together, our results indicate that nfe2l2 - related antioxidant defense pathways were insufficient to prevent oxidative damage in bone. changes in gene expression ( as early as 4 h or 1 day ) preceded bone loss, which manifested in these experiments by day 7 after exposure to 2 gy iron, although in some cases such as gamma irradiation and lower doses of iron, decrements in cancellous bone volume can be observed as early as 3 days after exposure ( kondo and others 2009 ; yumoto and others 2010 ). furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5 cgy iron",Ionizing Radiation Stimulates Expression of Pro-Osteoclastogenic Genes in Marrow and Skeletal Tissue,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4490751/,Orbit,2015

742,PMC5114340,discussion,0,"discussion we tested for co - regulation between changes in muscle and bone during removal and reapplication of weightbearing activities with the rationale that if muscle size controls bone size, we should observe robust correlations in the response of the two tissues. in contrast to this hypothesis, the magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. this lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. the strong qtl for changes in muscle area during unloading on chromosome 5 did not overlap with any qtls for changes in cortical bone properties but shared a common region for some trabecular properties. while these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle - bone unit that co - regulates its size during mechanical challenges. several limitations should be considered when interpreting results from this study. first, we did not measure changes in muscle strength but muscle cross - sectional area as a surrogate measure of strength is well accepted in clinical and animal studies [ 28 - 32 ]. second, we chose the composite cross - sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis ( and metaphysis ) of the mouse femur and because the µct images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. third, we observed musculoskeletal changes in unloading and reambulation over a 3wk period each, a duration that significantly altered musculo - skeletal variables at the mouse femur during both unloading and reambulation but it is conceivable that time periods of different length would influence our results and conclusions. using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements. lastly, qtl studies have many strengths including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified qtls typically requires substantial effort [ 33 ] as qtls can contain several hundred candidate genes",Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,Takeoff,2016
743,PMC5114340,discussion,1,"including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified qtls typically requires substantial effort [ 33 ] as qtls can contain several hundred candidate genes [ 18 ] and we are currently pursuing a combined bioinformatic / transgenic mouse approach towards this critical goal [ 34 ]. there was a relatively small number of mice that added muscle and / or bone tissue during unloading. while we don ’ t know the reason for this pattern, it is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. this is plausible because by breeding a f2 population, it is likely that some mice will have a phenotype well beyond the expected boundaries set by the two progenitor inbred strains [ 35 ]. because of the small number of mice displaying the opposite response pattern, no underlying qtls could be determined. inherently, it is also possible that noise in the data measurements contributed to this phenomenon. if it was true that combinations of polymorphisms cannot only prevent the catabolic response associated with unloading but can even produce a mild anabolic response, the identification of these polymorphisms may give rise to novel countermeasures. muscle - bone interactions have recently received considerable attention [ 6, 19, 36 ]. most of the interest has focused on molecular pathways by which muscle and bone can communicate with each other, rather than on how bone perceives forces produced by muscle. for instance, novel myokines have been identified that may either promote catabolism or anabolism in bone [ 20, 37 ]. we did not measure ( changes in ) biochemical factors here but the low correlations between muscle and bone at the genetic and tissue level may indicate that molecular cross - tissue communication is not necessarily driven by changes in muscle size. excellent relations between muscle and bone quantity have been reported in a number of species including mice and humans [ 38 ]. many of these studies were cross - sectional in nature, precluding mechanistic inferences. some longitudinal studies in mice have proposed functional relationships between changes in bone and muscle during ( un ) loading [ 39 - 41 ] but they were limited to temporal relations in a single inbred strain of mice. that our longitudinal study, taking advantage of a large sample of mice with greatly different mechano - responsivities, was not able to provide",Genetic and tissue level muscle-bone interactions during unloading and reambulation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114340/,Takeoff,2016

754,PMC5523082,introduction,0,"introduction filamentous fungi, such as species found within the genus aspergillus, are well known producers of secondary metabolites ( sms ) with interesting biological activities. the genome sequencing of aspergillus species revealed that the number of putative sm genes greatly exceeds the number of identified sms, suggesting many novel types of sms still remain to be discovered. 1 in general, these sm genes are clustered in the genome. 2 a typical cluster contains one key gene required for the synthesis of the precursor skeleton. these genes usually encode large multidomain enzymes belonging to the polyketide synthase ( pks ) or non - ribosomal peptide synthetase ( nrps ) class. 3 other adjacent genes encode enzymes that are involved in tailoring modifications, transport of the product, or co - regulation of the cluster genes. 4 in a given fungal species, the sm arsenal is usually governed by the number of key synthetic genes in the genome, and this diversity is multiplied by various tailoring enzymes that give rise to a considerable number of different natural products. 5 for instance, the fungus a. nidulans has 27 pks genes, 12 nrps genes, 14 nrps - like genes and one pks / nrps hybrid gene. 6 in a previous study, ahuja et al. systematically characterized the polyketide products of eight non reducing pkss ( nr - pkss ) in a. nidulans. 5 in combination with the six previously characterized nr - pks genes, the study demonstrated that the 14 nr - pks genes in a. nidulans could be divided into seven groups based on phylogenetic analysis. more importantly, each of these nr - pkss produces a unique product which can be modified by other tailoring enzymes and incorporate into various sm biosynthetic pathways, indicating the potential of a. nidulans for biosynthesizing a large variety of different pks - derived sms. 5 recently, application of an efficient gene targeting system enabled us to link two nrps - like genes apva and btya to their corresponding sms, aspulvinones and butyrolactones, respectively, in a. terreus strain nih 2624. 7 in this study, we demonstrated that one nrps - like gene, atmela, is involved in the synthesis of a brown conidial melanin in this fungus. 7 compared to typical nrpss, nrps - like genes encode single module (","Spatial regulation of a common precursor from two distinct genes generates metabolite diversity†

790,PMC5955502,introduction,0,"introduction under microgravity conditions, there are different negative changes in the skeletal, muscle and cardiovascular systems. animal experiments have facilitated the investigation of the structural changes in the myocardium and skeletal muscles that arise during space flights. previous research has revealed atrophic changes in the skeletal muscles of rats after space flight [ 1 – 4 ]. moreover, early readaptation leads to more pronounced negative changes in the structure of muscle fibers than those observed immediately after the flight [ 5 – 7 ]. a fluid shift in the cranial direction [ 8, 9 ] and changes in systolic output [ 10 – 12 ] that are observed under conditions of weightlessness, could lead to functional changes in the cardiovascular system. nevertheless, despite the decrease in the functional capabilities of the myocardium under conditions of microgravity, structural changes in the myocardium have not been observed after landing [ 1 ]. data obtained from murine cardiomyocytes after the flight of the bion - m biosatellite no. 1 ( dissection was carried out within 13 – 16. 5 hours after landing ) indicated that the levels of cytoskeletal proteins ( beta - and gamma - actin, actin - binding proteins, desmin, and tubulin ), as well as the expression levels of the genes encoding those proteins, were significantly changed after a 30 - day space flight [ 13 ]. in the same experiment, povysheva t. v. et al. showed that there were also changes in the structure of the myelinated fibers [ 14 ]. similar effects were also observed in cells cultivated under conditions simulating the effects of microgravity. it was shown under such conditions, a change in the structure of microfilaments and microtubules occurs in mesenchymal stem and embryonic stem cells, leading to a change in the cellular shape and differentiation potential [ 15 – 21 ]. moreover, it was shown by live - cell imaging that poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells ( ftc - 133 ) developed less aggressive phenotypes under microgravity conditions [ 22 ]. however, recently obtained data indicate that under conditions of real weightlessness, the rearrangements of f - actin and intermediate filaments were not observed in macrophages [ 23 ]. the effects of microgravity on gene expression have been documented in mammalian cells [ 24, 25 ] and other model organisms, such as yeast and bacteria [ 26 – 28 ]. however, the",Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Orbit,2018

[ 32 ] conducted experiments with rice plants during space flight and only showed hypermethylation that correlated with the transcription levels of genes. in contrast, singh k. p. et al. [ 33 ] studied human t - lymphocyte cells, which were grown in a rotary cell culture system, and showed hypomethylation of the dna. chowdhury b. et al. [ 34 ] used tk6 human lymphoblastoid cells and ground - based simulation of microgravity with an harv rotary cell culture system for 48 hours and revealed that simulated microgravity induced alterations in the methylome ( ~ 60 % of the differentially methylated regions or dmrs were hypomethylated and ~ 92 % of the differentially hydroxymethylated regions or dhmrs were hyperhydroxymethylated ). therefore, there is a substantial amount of conflicting data regarding the effects of space flight on cell structure and the regulation of transcription, which may be due to varying periods between landing and biomaterial fixation. we suggest that for cardiac tissue, the early period of readaptation is accompanied by a decrease in volume load due to fluid shift. it could lead to the changes of the cortical cytoskeleton structure that were observed after the bion - m1 mission [ 13 ]. therefore, we were interested in comparing the data from that biomaterial with data from biomaterial fixed under weightlessness conditions to avoid landing and readaptation effects. it can be assumed that such a",Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Orbit,2018

799,PMC5955502,discussion,0,"discussion the influence of the changes in external mechanical conditions, particularly gravity changes, on the cells of organisms that have evolved in earth ’ s gravity conditions is still poorly understood. the main difficulty is the extrapolation of ground experimental data to the prediction of results under weightlessness conditions. previous experiments conducted under space flight conditions were limited by the fact that the biomaterial of the flight animals could only be fixed after landing, usually occurring a few hours after the landing [ 1 – 7, 13 ]. therefore, this experiment is the first in the history of human space exploration with the unique opportunity to fix mouse biomaterial under space flight conditions. comparing these results with the results obtained after the bion - m biosatellite no. 1 flight of the same length, a number of deductions can be made regarding the structural changes in the cells as a result of the early period of readaptation to earth ’ s gravity. long duration microgravity does not lead to notable changes in cytoskeletal protein contents in the cardiac and lung tissue the relative contents of beta - actin, gamma - actin, beta - tubulin and desmin both in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of the cardiac tissue remained at the same level in all the study groups. these data agree with data tauber s. et al. showed for macrophages, which were also recorded under weightlessness conditions in the iss ( space - x3 mission ). in addition, changes of the cytoskeleton structure after an 11 - day spaceflight were not observed [ 23 ]. the contents of the actin - binding proteins alpha - actinin - 1 and alpha - actinin - 4 in the membrane fraction were also unchanged. however, in the cytoplasmic fraction, alpha - actinin - 1 decreased by 40 % ( p < 0. 05 ), and alpha - actinin - 4 decreased by 30 % ( p < 0. 05 ) in group f compared to group g. the previous data from the 30 - day space flight of the bion - m biosatellite no. 1 ( 2013, russia ) showed that the beta - actin content in the membrane fraction of proteins was at the same level, while in the cytoplasmic fraction, there was a decrease in the beta - actin protein and mrna expression levels in the flight group [ 13 ]. the gamma - actin mrna and protein contents were unchanged. the alpha - actinin - 1 protein content",Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Orbit,2018

[ 32 ] obtained after space flight. however, the mechanisms underlying the changes of the methylation levels after space flight are currently unknown. the methylation level of the genome increased because heavy ions radiation, which can make a difference in the space flight conditions [ 51, 52 ]. in addition, this can contribute to the observed increase in the methylation level in the flight group. however, this contribution is unlikely to be decisive, since this experiment was conducted on board an international space station. animals and humans were in the same compartments, which have both special protection against cosmic radiation and natural protection, since the orbit passes below the earth ' s magnetosphere. in general, it is known that that de novo methylation can be mediated by histone deacetylation in the nucleosome area [ 53 – 58 ]. in addition, changes of methylation levels can result from increases in the methylase activity / content.",Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Orbit,2018

[ 32 ] found that several genes encoding the various putative dna methyltransferases, 5 - methylcytosine dna glycosylases, the swi / snf chromatin remodeler ( ddm1 ) and sirna - related proteins are extremely sensitive to perturbation by space flight, which may be an underlying cause for the altered methylation patterns in plants subjected to space flight. therefore, we decided to assess the expression level of genes encoding methylases as well as the basic histone acetylase / deacetylase. the obtained results indicate that the gene expression levels of the histone aminotransferase hat1, the histone deacetylase hdac1, and the cytosine methylases dnmt1 ( s - phase methylation ) and dnmt3a ( de novo methylation ) were unchanged under weightlessness conditions. on the other hand, the methylation level can increase as a result of a reduction of the intensity of active dna demethylation. researchers believe that 5 hmc is the intermediate product in the process of active dna demethylation [ 59 – 63 ] and is generated by ten - eleven translocation ( tet ) protein - mediated oxidative catalysis of 5mc [ 64 ]. therefore, we measured the mrna content of cytosine demethylases ( tet1, tet2, tet3 ) in the tested tissues. there were no changes in tet1 and tet3 mrna content,",Cytoskeleton structure and total methylation of mouse cardiac and lung tissue during space flight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5955502/,Orbit,2018

827,PMC6204554,introduction,0,"introduction gravity is a natural force that drives all living organisms to acquire precise physiological mechanisms to survive. throughout the course of a species ’ evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. the highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity ’ s continuous influence ( stensio, 1927 ; friedman and giles, 2017 ). detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self - motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. the first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today ’ s aquatic invertebrates ( budelmann, 1988 ). otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. in an earlier study ( boyle et al., 2001 ) fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents. pervasiveness of gravity provides the nervous system a common reference about which to optimize sensory transduction mechanisms and perception. otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito - inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum ( see goldberg et al., 2012 ). there the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. the end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self - motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. despite invariability of gravity on earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito - inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders. arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. the established reference of self - orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018
828,PMC6204554,introduction,1,", disorientation, and other clinical disorders. arrival of aviation and space age offered a means to directly study the role of gravity in healthy subjects. the established reference of self - orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. during the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation ( reschke et al., 1994 ; demontis et al., 2017 ) linked to the otolith organs ( watt et al., 1986 ; paloski et al., 1993 ; heer and paloski, 2006 ). an extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard shuttle orbiters ( boyle et al., 2001 ). the hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space ( reschke et al., 1994 ). physiological adjustments to a novel gravity, as witnessed in spaceflight, reveal that the organism possesses adaptive mechanisms triggered by transitions in gravity. what initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? in addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. activation of olivo - cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound ( warr and guinan, 1979 ; liberman, 1980 ; groff and liberman, 2003 ). in functional terms, this efferent - to - afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way ( brown et al., 1983 ; russell and murugasu, 1997 ). analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents ( smith and rasmussen, 1968 ; sans and highstein, 1984 ; holstein et al., 2004 ; lysakowski and goldberg, 2008 ), and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish ( flock and russell, 1976 ; hartmann and klinke, 1980 ;","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018

( 2016 ) measured in 1 g the ocular counterrolling ( ocr ), an otolith - mediated reflex, during centrifugation before and after a 6 - month stay in space in 25 astronauts and found a significant reduction in ocr magnitude after landing and its restoration to normal levels in 9 days. their results are largely in agreement with changes in gaze control reported by kornilova et al. ( 2012 ) in cosmonauts to 129 – 215 days in space. adaptation to microgram is likely to change over time from an initial over compensation to restore normalcy to a hyposensitivity more in line with the prevailing gravity. do the processes of adaptation to microgram in orbit or weightlessness in deep space missions reach a plateau or continue to evolve in time are questions yet to be answered. utricular afferent responses after hypergravity exposure based on the robustness of postflight hypersensitivity of utricular afferents, we expected to find a compensatory hyposensitivity in response to hg. the initial hypersensitivity was unexpected and developed at day 3 and peaked at day 4. it was followed by a period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated hyposensitivity after 16 – 32 days of hg. initial hypersensitivity was robust and recovered to normal levels after – 6 days at 1 g. utricular afferent response to hg did not reflect a systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since hc afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of hg in the same fish. occs performed at 4 - or 16 - day exposure to","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018

( a ) transducer changes. prolonged deviation of the sensory hair bundle leads to an adaptation of otolith hair cell receptor potentials ( eatock et al., 1987 ; goldberg et al., 2012 ). manifestation of this adaptation can be seen in responses of some otolith afferents to prolonged steps of linear acceleration ( fernandez and goldberg, 1976a, b ). microgravity might be thought of as a step of hair bundle motion in the “ off ” direction, and adaptation in transducer mechanism ( s ) might negate any aberrant afferent response in microgram. the converse might occur in hg. the onset and time course of transducer adaptation might be both rapid and long - lasting, and involve a reconfiguration of the transmembrane channel ( tmc ) - like proteins of the transducer pore ( pan et al., 2018 ). our data do not offer a clear insight. ( b ) structural changes of otolith mass. otolith weight by gravity intensities might regulate the otoconia mass and alter its coupling to stereocilia in a manner that affects mechanotransduction, for example a change of otolith – stereociliary coupling that adjusts bundle deflection for a given movement ( fredrickson - hemsing et al., 2012 ). wiederhold et al. ( 1997, 2000 ) showed that the otolith mass in growing snails was increased by microgram exposure. a slowing in otolith growth during development was reported to occur under hg conditions in neonate fish ( anken et al., 2000a ), and also after vestibular nerve transection again in neonates ( anken et al., 2000b ). however, lim et al. ( 1974 ) and sondag et al. ( 1995 ) in well - controlled studies could not demonstrate any change in the otoconia ca + 2 content, shape, size, or distribution in adult hamsters subjected to hg. more recently, aceto et al. ( 2015 ) found a decrease in otolith calcification after prolonged hg exposure in zebrafish, presumably the result of a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein productions ( anken et al., 2004 ; anken, 2006","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018
858,PMC6204554,discussion,6,"found a decrease in otolith calcification after prolonged hg exposure in zebrafish, presumably the result of a regulation of carbonic anhydrase and other matrix protein productions ( anken et al., 2004 ; anken, 2006 ). as bone is adversely remodeled during space missions ( demontis et al., 2017 ), calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited on existing otoconia to provide greater “ weight ” in an effort to restore the “ gain ” of gravity sensation ; conversely, hg would lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to “ rebalance ” function. our afferent recordings did not reveal any aberration ( s ) in discharge properties or spurious excitations except a change in response sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation, the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed. although this mechanism is attractive, particularly for long - term habituation in a reduced gravity, we have no data collected in this study that directly addresses this mechanism. ( c ) synaptic plasticity. a widely considered candidate responsible in the adaptive response to microgram is plasticity of hair cell ribbon synapses ( moser et al., 2006 ). the findings of ross ( 2000 ) promoted this hypothesis : number of ribbon synapses in certain type ii hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55 % following exposure to microgram ; type i hair cells were less affected. toadfish vestibular epithelia possess only type ii hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen in reptiles, birds, and mammals. also in toadfish the number of en passant and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal afferent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity ( boyle et al., 1991 ). thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with our observed post - flight hypersensitivity in toadfish utricular afferents. however, more recent evidence by sultemeier et al. ( 2017 ) in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. they found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and hc cristae. although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018
859,PMC6204554,discussion,7,"found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and hc cristae. although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based on body mass, this discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. as we discuss below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3d serial reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the same animal. an important piece of relevant evidence is the time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures. turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems are useful. ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino rat are said to have a life span of h ( spadero et al., 1978 ) and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and disassembly processes ( schmidt and drenckhahn, 1993 ) during development ( regus - leidig et al., 2009 ). in the hippocampus, asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes ( desmond and levy, 1986 ). although related to different systems, these data indicate that specific times of synapse formation are from minutes to hours ( cragg, 1969 ; cotman and nieto - sampedro, 1982 ). further, puro et al. ( 1977 ) showed that synapses not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases during development, suggesting that both synapse formation and termination rates are regulated and that the specificity of synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination of synapses. thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor downregulation and “ anchors ” inside the cell mark the former receptor sites ( ziff and barry, 2002 ). since the sudden change of gravity is an extreme condition, the specific time of synapse rearrangement might be expected to be longer : from hours to several days. despite the attractiveness of synaptic bodies being added or subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity, a key finding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis. in the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4 - or","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018
860,PMC6204554,discussion,8,"added or subtracted as needed to regulate the system response to gravity, a key finding here is in direct opposition to this hypothesis. in the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4 - or 16 - day of 2. 24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3d ultrastructural reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola and in the predominant medial extrastriola region. afferents had highly significant differences in smax ( figure 11a ) and average ir per cycle ( figure 11b ) with virtually little to no overlap. even with this clear distinction in utricular physiology, sb counts per hair cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three afferent populations in both macular regions measured in the same fish : hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large ( figure 11c ). afferent smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a group from the other populations. the importance of this finding is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in the same animal, and no direct correlation was found. it might be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted over the course of afferent recordings. we saw no indication of this : afferents after 4 and 16 days of hg were hyper - and hypo - sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the finish of the recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. clearly other factors might be in play. for example, adjustment of synaptic efficacy or strength might involve many processes other than the sb itself, such as hebbian plasticity based on the correlation of pre - and post - synaptic cells ( matsubara and uehara, 2016 ). suli et al. ( 2016 ) have provided some key insights into synaptic plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. using transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines they found that innervation was crucial for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the mature synapse. how synaptic weights and innervation patterns might scale up or down or fluctuate in distribution within the hair cell – afferent complexes need to be examined in our model.

( d ) a neural feedback circuit. it is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent ( evs ) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. in general, the evs provides hair cell organs not only with the means to control passive filtering of sound and motion signals, but also to regulate the mechanical gain of the living amplifiers in the ear ( hudspeth, 2008 ; rabbitt and brownell, 2011 ). efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. a typical efferent neuron in toadfish has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem, thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth of descending command and ascending sensory information ( highstein and baker, 1986 ; confirmed in the present study, q. v. supplementary figure 3 ). spatial coding is likely not selective, since efferent fibers can innervate multiple end organs on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate both labyrinths ( schwarz et al., 1981 ; eden and correia, 1982 ; strutz, 1982 ; dechesne et al., 1984 ; highstein and baker, 1986 ; valli et al., 1986 ; dickman and correia, 1992 ; fujino et al., 1993 ; marco et al., 1993 ; birinyi et al., 2001 ; chi et al., 2007 ). does the evs participate in the adaptive processes observed after exposures to hg? we addressed this question indirectly in this study by ( 1 ) inferring evs action on the hair cell by comparing smax observed in each experimental group ( table 1 ), ( 2 ) inferring evs action on the afferent by comparing average ir at smax ( ir, in ips / cycle ) observed in each experimental group ( table 1 ), and ( 3 ) pairing the mir ( in ips ) with and without evs stimulation in absence of acceleration in the same afferent in each experimental group ( table 2 ). a more direct measure to determine evs role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. for example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018

( 2015 ). in a semi - isolated preparation, which permits identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval xenopus it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated efferent neurons during fictive swimming. during these phasic epochs of efferent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction of afferent responses to vestibular - related stimuli. thus, similar to toadfish, the evs of xenopus can effectively optimize sensory processing. no presumed efferent neurons were encountered in the utricular nerve that consistently responded to applied otolith ( linear acceleration or body roll / pitch ) or canal ( yaw rotation or head down / up pitch ) stimuli. given their low discharge at rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, efferent neurons likely provide more episodic control over","Influence of Magnitude and Duration of Altered Gravity and Readaptation to 1 g on the Structure and Function of the Utricle in Toadfish, Opsanus tau",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6204554/,Orbit,2018

877,PMC6452512,discussion,0,"discussion the iss environmental microbiome was characterized from eight locations throughout the iss during three flight sampling events over a period of 14 months. this allowed the examination of temporal and spatial distribution of microbial populations on the iss. this is the first study to utilize culture, qpcr, and amplicon sequencing to study the surfaces of the us segment and revealed a diverse intact / viable population of bacteria and fungi that changed over time but were similar across locations. several studies have been carried out to measure microbiological cleanliness of the iss environment using cultivation - based approaches since the inception of this closed system [ 35 ]. recently, several iss surfaces in the us nodes [ 36 ] and japanese kibo module [ 37 ] were swabbed and targeted amplicon sequencing carried out. however, these studies did not measure the intact / viable microbiome which therefore could not be compared to culture counts nor provide an assessment for crew risk. previous reports on the iss intact / viable microbiomes on the iss were only examined from air filters and debris collected via vacuum cleaner bag [ 2 ]. the iss is a unique environment and one question that is of interest to many is how this intact / viable microbiome compares to other closed, regulated environments ( additional file 1 : figure s9 and fig. 7 ). the iss environmental microbiome resembles that of animal skin surfaces rather more than the soil microbiome. this might be due to the fact that cargo sent to the space station was cleaned thoroughly, and hence soil - associated microorganisms were not present. the predominant organisms on iss surfaces consisted of those that are associated with humans, with some considered opportunistic pathogens on earth. as to whether they could cause disease in astronauts on the iss is unknown, as it would depend on the health status of each individual and how these organisms function while in the space environment. regardless, the detection of possible disease - causing organisms highlights the importance of further genomic and transcriptomic studies to examine how these iss microbes function in space and how they may impact astronauts ’ health. correlating viable but opportunistic pathogens with crew member health is likely to raise too many questions about access to the crew microbiome data which is not yet publicly available, and about statistical power : because the iss has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. from the time the iss was built in 1998, as of aug 3, 2017",Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,Orbit,2019
878,PMC6452512,discussion,1,"power : because the iss has few occupants and high turnover, identifying statistically relevant trends in crew member health that correlate with environmental microbiomes is not possible. from the time the iss was built in 1998, as of aug 3, 2017, 222 astronauts visited the iss, and microbial signatures left behind by previous astronauts might interfere with the predictions. consequently, the present iss environmental microbial metrics could not be linked to any particular crew member. since there were no differences in community composition and richness between pma - and non - pma treated samples, it suggests that the dna analyzed from these possible opportunistic pathogens residing on the iss environmental surfaces are indeed intact / viable and not dead organisms. noteworthy, approximately 46 % of intact / viable bacteria and 40 % of intact / viable fungi could be cultured with the culture media used during this study. this percentage is high when compared to spacecraft assembly cleanrooms on earth where only 1 to 10 % of intact / viable microorganisms can be cultured [ 38 ]. the possible explanation is that the iss is not deprived of nutrients like spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and while this is a hermetically sealed environment, it is exposed to microbes from astronauts ( maximum six astronauts at a given time ) and cargo ( delivered ~ 4 – 6 times per year ). furthermore, no relationship was found between microbial load and sample processing time ( f1 : 7 days, f2 : 9 days, and f3 : 6 days ). many of the organisms detected on the iss are known to form biofilms that belong to both bacterial ( acinetobacter, sphingomonas, bacillus, burkholderia, corynebacterium, and klebsiella ) [ 39 ] and fungal ( penicillium, aspergillus, cryptococcus, and rhodotorula ) [ 40 ] genera. this could pose problems for astronauts if they do become infected as biofilms are known to promote resistance to antibiotics [ 41 ]. also, biofilm formation on the iss could decrease infrastructure stability by causing mechanical blockages, reducing heat transfer efficiency, and inducing microbial influenced corrosion [ 42 ]. some of the microorganisms that were identified on the iss that have been implicated in microbial - induced corrosion on earth are methylobacterium, sphingomonas, bacillus, penicillium, and aspergillus [ 43 – 46 ] ; however, the role they",Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,Orbit,2019

880,PMC6452512,discussion,3,"the family staphylococcaceae and enterobacteriaceae were the most predominant organisms on iss surfaces of the us module, similar to what has been published for the japanese module of the iss [ 52 ], and were detected in almost every sample by both culture and amplicon sequencing ( additional file 1 : figure s10 ). both are human - associated organisms, with staphylococcaceae commonly found on the skin and in the nasal passage, and enterobacteriaceae commonly associated with the gastrointestinal tract. these two taxa are also abundant in fitness centers [ 53 ], office buildings [ 54 ], and hospitals [ 5 ], suggesting that the iss is similar to other built environments on earth, in that its microbiome is shaped by human occupation [ 32 ]. on earth, it has been observed that incoming intensive care unit ( icu ) patients have a significantly higher risk of acquiring infections if the previous occupant was a carrier, despite terminal cleaning of the bed and the room [ 55 – 57 ]. thus, habitation of the same area, regardless of whether individuals interact or not, may contribute to disease spread. further studies assessing how long organisms survive on iss surfaces and how readily they can be passed on from one individual to another in space can lead to the development of countermeasures to minimize the spread of infections from one astronaut to another during simultaneous or even separate flight missions. methylobacteriaceae / methylobacterium was also dominant across the iss and could be cultured from several samples. this is a hardy organism that can withstand harsh conditions, such as ionizing radiation and strong cleaning detergents and has previously been found in nasa spacecraft assembly clean rooms [ 58 ], hospital icus [ 59 ], and the mars500 habitat [ 60 ]. moraxallaceae, another abundant organism on the iss, also thrives in harsh conditions, being present in higher relative abundances in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms [ 61 ], areas of the home that utilize a lot of chemicals ( i. e., washing machine ) [ 62 ], and deep sea sediment of inactive hydrothermal vents [ 63 ]. r. mucilaginosa was the predominant fungal isolate from the culture analysis, and belongs to the sporidiobolaceae family which was found in high relative abundances across the iss with amplicon sequencing. this organism can survive inside dishwashers despite high temperatures and chemical exposure [ 64 ]. numerous studies conducted on earth have shown that the",Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,Orbit,2019

[ 32 ] in an inflated lunar / mars analog habitat, the cultivable bacterial load was in the range of 10 3 – 10 5 per m 2 after the student crew inhabited the analog station. there were no significant changes in microbial load between the more active areas like the laboratory and other locations, while bedroom cultivable bacterial load increased toward the end of 30 - day occupation. the fungal cultivable population was lower than bacterial, but it was in the range from 10 2 to 10 4 per m 2 [ 68 ]. in contrast, the iss results showed that cultivable microbial load were not uniform between locations and warrant more study. in general, temporal differences were observed within the bacterial population : f2 samples had higher microbial diversity ( alpha diversity ) than f1 and f3 samples ; only enterobacteriaceae were cultured from f3 samples and nine out of the ten most relatively abundant family level taxa differed over the three flights. these temporal differences may be due to the different occupants onboard the iss during each of the",Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,Orbit,2019

( iii ) lastly, all statistical analyses were performed with aldex2 which estimates per - feature technical variation within each sample using monte - carlo instances drawn from dirichlet distributions. aldex2 uses the centered log - ratio transformation that ensures that data are scale invariant and sub - compositionally coherent meaning that all samples are numerical consistent with each other, regardless of the total sequencing read capacity at the time of sequencing [ 70, 71 ]. this ensures that the statistical results are robust and are not influenced solely by the differential detection of asvs that can occur during different sequencing runs. many 16s rrna and its sequences could not be identified via amplicon - targeted analyses, but a metagenomics approach recently conducted identified 318 bacterial and fungal species in these samples [ 72 ]. in addition, shotgun metagenome analysis carried out by singh et al. [ 72 ] from the same samples revealed that reads associated with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid derivatives and cofactors, vitamins, etc. were the highest among all three flights. similarly, computational analyses showed that the legionella resistome, cobalt - zinc - cadmium resistance, and multi - drug resistant resistance efflux pump were high on all flights and all locations. the shot - gun reads associated with antimicrobial resistant genes in flight 3 increased by twofold when compared with flights 1 and 2 which also predicted the persistence of opportunistic pathogens in flight 3 samples [ 72 ]. collective beta - lactam resistance derived from the metagenome sequence analysis shows that physical ( ompf, ompc ), transformational ( penicillin - binding protein ), and degradational ( ampc ), and mdr efflux pump ( omp, rnd, mpf ) mechanisms were allocated by the microorganisms on the iss [ 72 ]. exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of intact / viable microbial populations of closed systems such as the iss will facilitate planning of future human habitation of moon, mars, and beyond. accumulation of intact / viable microbial cells in a confined environment poses a health risk to all inhabitants. this study on bacterial and fungal load and diversity across",Characterization of the total and viable bacterial and fungal communities associated with the International Space Station surfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6452512/,Orbit,2019

973,PMC7162976,discussion,0,"discussion in this study, we investigated the bone protective potential of dp against independent and combined effects of simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation on the microarchitecture and mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. a diet supplemented with dp prevented most of the simulated spaceflight - induced damages to both the appendicular ( i. e. tibia ) and axial ( i. e. vertebrae ) skeleton. when mice were fed the control diet, a relatively high dose ( 2 gy ) of low - let gamma radiation exclusively decreased the bv / tv and tb. sp of cancellous tissue in the tibia. based on our results, cancellous bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which overall, expanded the space between trabeculae. hu for 14 days caused bone loss within both cancellous and cortical regions of the tibia and the l4 vertebrae. hu also led to reduced compressive strength of the vertebral body. the independent effects of hu and ir remained of similar magnitude in each tissue compartment when mice were exposed to hu and ir simultaneously. regardless of the treatment ( with one exception, ct. th proximal tibia ), consumption of the dried plum diet prevented detrimental skeletal changes. mice fed the control diet and exposed solely to ir displayed a 20 % decrement in bv / tv and a 7 % increase in the tb. sp of the tibia ’ s cancellous region relative to the sham control. these parameters were unaffected by hu alone. hu groups exhibited a lesser 11 % decrement in tb. th. when ir was combined with hu, bv / tv decreased by another 5 %. these results indicate that hu and ir were not clearly additive in this experiment. among the parameters analyzed, ir only induced changes in tb. th and tb. sp. unlike reports by others, there were no significant changes in tb. n from any of the treatment groups relative to the sham - irradiated control group 21, 43, 44. when hu was combined with ir, tb. th decreased by 9 %. our results indicate bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which expanded the space between trabeculae. the trabeculae contribute to percent bone volume and microarchitectural integrity. since hu affects the cortical as well as cancellous tissue, we also determined the extent of co",Dietary countermeasure mitigates simulated spaceflight-induced osteopenia in mice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162976/,Orbit,2020

979,PMC7264257,introduction,0,"introduction food production during human space missions to and on moon and mars is a necessary step to reduce resupply mass from earth and thus long - term mission costs. growing plants for food production also offers the advantages of producing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as well as the recycling of water. because of these advantages, experiments in growing plants in space began as early as the first manned space stations and continue to the present day ( zabel et al., 2016a ). several research teams conducted experiments in cultivating plants in a closed controlled environment on earth for the application in future space missions in the past ( wheeler, 2017 ). notable are nasa ’ s biomass production chamber ( wheeler et al., 2003 ; dreschel et al., 2018 ), the russian bios facilities ( gitelson et al., 2003 ), the japanese closed ecology experimental facility ( nitta, 2005 ) and the chinese lunar palace 1 ( fu et al., 2016 ). the eden iss project is the newest space greenhouse analog project to test subsystems, technologies, operation procedures, plant health monitoring devices and plant cultivation for future space missions. the eden iss mobile test facility ( mtf ) ( figure 1 ) was setup in antarctica to achieve these goals. this paper presents detailed values on food production ( edible biomass ) and inedible biomass production of the vegetable crops cultivated in the experimental phase in 2018. figure 1 the eden iss mobile test facility in antarctica around 400 m south of the german neumayer station iii. the difference of the eden iss mtf to the other facilities is its unique location. the mtf is positioned in the vicinity of the german neumayer station iii in antarctica. this continent offers several conditions which are favorable for space analog test campaigns ( bubenheim et al., 1994 ). while most of the other facilities were built to conduct research on humans living in a closed loop life support system, eden iss focuses on cultivating plants in controlled conditions, testing the necessary hardware and investigating microbiology, food quality and safety aspects. furthermore, most of the facilities mentioned earlier were built and operated in the 1980s – 2000s and are no longer available, except for lunar palace 1 which was built only a few years ago and is still in operation. eden iss also uses technologies which were not available in the past ( e. g., led lighting for plant cultivation ). the novel aspect of the eden iss project is its approach to work with a compromise climate in which all crops are grown simultaneously. this is more realistic for",Biomass Production of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica During the 2018 Experiment Phase,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7264257/,Orbit,2020

( 2017 ) showed that scd1 - 2 has altered pin2 - gfp trafficking during treatment with brefeldin a, a drug which blocks intracellular endosome and trans - golgi transport. however, we find that in scd1 - 1 at the restrictive temperature, pin2 - gfp accumulates in the absence of bfa. the trafficking defect is not detectable in scd1 - 1 roots grown at 18°c, but when switched from 18 to 25°c, the pin2 trafficking defect becomes apparent within minutes. since changes in auxin transport and root growth and development are not observed for 8 – 12 h, this suggests that these responses are sequential and that pin mislocalization is not a secondary result of compromised root development at 25°c. the linkage is most evident in terms of gravity response. pin2 controls shootward auxin transport that is required for gravitropism ( muller et al., 1998 ; rashotte et al., 2000 ; chen et al., 2002 ). upon transition of scd1","A Conditional Mutation in SCD1 Reveals Linkage Between PIN Protein Trafficking, Auxin Transport, Gravitropism, and Lateral Root Initiation",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358545/,Takeoff,2020

1051,PMC7607443,introduction,0,"introduction space exploration will soon include new human missions to the moon as a first step in the human exploration of mars. recent studies in human ( i. e., nasa twin study, garrett - bakelman et al., 2019 ) and mammalian systems ( rodent missions, beheshti et al., 2019 ; ronca et al., 2019 ) are paving the way to understand the effects of the microgravity environment on human physiology, but human life in space will rely on the essential role of plants in bioregenerative life support systems ( zabel et al., 2016 ), not only as a source of water, food, and removal of co 2 but also by providing a terrestrial - like environment for the psychological well - being of astronauts. due to their sessile condition, plants have to promote adaptive responses to cope with changes in environmental conditions. light plays multiple roles in the mechanisms of these adaptive responses. on the one hand, light is the source of energy by means of photosynthesis and regulates indirectly cell proliferation and cell growth via the central regulator tor kinase through the expression of s - phase genes, and also ribosome biogenesis ( caldana et al., 2013 ; xiong et al., 2013 ; sablowski and carnier dornelas, 2014 ). in addition, light is a major driver in the establishment of the patterns of plant growth and development, by means of phototropism and photomorphogenesis. in playing this role, light is associated with gravity as one of the major tropistic cues, such that gravitropism and phototropism ( and the interaction between them ) are essential modulators of plant development ( vandenbrink et al., 2014 ). at the cellular and molecular levels, plant development relies on the activity of cell growth and proliferation taking place in the meristems, which supply differentiated cells and are influenced by the tropistic cues ( perrot - rechenmann, 2010 ). darkness is indeed a stress condition for plants. several articles describe that in the dark, apical meristem proliferation is arrested in the g1 and g2 phases of the cell cycle ( lopez - juez et al., 2008 ; mohammed et al., 2017 ), but in the root meristem, light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation ( silva - navas et al., 2016 ). this reduction could be",The Importance of Earth Reference Controls in Spaceflight -Omics Research: Characterization of Nucleolin Mutants from the Seedling Growth Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607443/,Orbit,2020
1052,PMC7607443,introduction,1,", 2017 ), but in the root meristem, light induces the production of flavonols and other metabolites leading to the reduction of cell proliferation ( silva - navas et al., 2016 ). this reduction could be related to the sugar starvation that results from the inability to perform photosynthesis. however, red light has a stimulating effect on ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. an increase in the mitotic index, in the expression of some regulators of these processes at both gene expression and protein levels, and in post - translational modifications of some protein factors has been described in plants irradiated with red light ( tong et al., 1997 ; reichler et al., 2001 ). the absence of gravity ( weightlessness, or microgravity, as it exists in free - fall, or in spaceflight ) is also, by itself, a stress condition for plants, and specifically for the functions of meristematic cells ( matia et al., 2010 ; boucheron - dubuisson et al., 2016 ). an experiment performed in the international space station ( iss ) in which arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grew for 4 days in darkness resulted in an increase in the rate of cell proliferation and a decrease in the cell growth rate, estimated by the activity of ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, compared with the 1 g control ( matia et al., 2010 ). as the coordination of these two activities defines meristematic competence, the effect of the lack of tropistic stimuli, particularly of gravity signals, may result in serious alterations of the developmental pattern of the plant, as was also shown in simulated microgravity experiments ( boucheron - dubuisson et al., 2016 ). the seedling growth ( sg ) experiments, recently performed in the iss, aimed at unraveling the link between phototropism and gravitropism, using the weightless environment of spaceflight ( vandenbrink et al., 2019 ; herranz et al., 2019 ). in the first sg experiment, a. thaliana seedlings corresponding to wild - type ( wt ) ecotype landsberg erecta ( ler ) and two phytochrome mutants ( phya and phyb ) known to be involved in phototropism ( kiss et al., 2003 ; molas and kiss, 2008 ) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated",The Importance of Earth Reference Controls in Spaceflight -Omics Research: Characterization of Nucleolin Mutants from the Seedling Growth Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607443/,Orbit,2020
1053,PMC7607443,introduction,2,"phytochrome mutants ( phya and phyb ) known to be involved in phototropism ( kiss et al., 2003 ; molas and kiss, 2008 ) were grown in space for 6 days and photostimulated for the last 2 days, revealing differential blue and red light phototropism in space ( vandenbrink et al., 2016 ). the analysis of the expression of regulatory genes of cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis showed that red light irradiation produced a significant reversion of the uncoupling of cell proliferation and cell growth caused by microgravity in darkness ( matia et al., 2010 ) and, consequently, a compensation of the loss of meristematic competence ( valbuena et al., 2018 ). in view of these results from our previous space experiments, we decided to focus on the cellular process of ribosome biogenesis for the successive spaceflight experiments of the sg project, with the purpose of testing the separate and synergistic effects of the light and gravity tropistic signals on specific molecular and cellular components of this process. ribosome biogenesis, which takes place in the nucleolus, represents the most complex multi - step process that the cell must perform and is one of the most intricately regulated and controlled ( saez - vasquez and medina, 2008 ; pelletier et al., 2018 ). therefore, its regulation must adapt to the environmental conditions in which the cell finds itself and coordinate with other cellular processes, such as cell division and differentiation. several studies have described and used the nucleolus as a major stress sensor, using stress - induced changes in the organization and composition of this organelle ( mayer and grummt, 2005 ; boulon et al., 2010 ; lewinska et al., 2010 ; kalinina et al., 2018 ). briefly, ribosome biogenesis consists of the transcription of 45s rrna genes ( 45s rdna ) containing the sequences of 18s, 5. 8s, and 25s rrnas, followed by the multi - step cleavage of 45s pre - rrna to produce, in association with 5s rrna and ribosomal proteins ( rps ), the mature ribosomal subunits, which are then exported to the cytoplasm and assembled as mature ribosomes. in addition to rps, hundreds of non - ribosomal proteins ( nrps ), or nucleolar",The Importance of Earth Reference Controls in Spaceflight -Omics Research: Characterization of Nucleolin Mutants from the Seedling Growth Experiments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607443/,Orbit,2020

1085,PMC7733933,discussion,0,"discussion our data describe diverse responses to separate desiccation and high temperature stresses. as stated under section “ materials and methods, ” it is important to reiterate the arbitrary nature of the study. the problematic aspects include the duration of the temperature treatment and the testing of various processes and enzymatic activities. it is unlikely that in nature temperatures greater than 40°c extend for more than 12 h. nonetheless, heat tolerance was tested previously for an equally arbitrary time of 30 min, which resulted in tolerance of > 100°c ( lange, 1955 ). while evaporative cooling likely provides some protection during short - term heat exposure, our heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. similarly, submersion of fronds eliminates water stress but may cause different stress for the epiphytic pleopletis as was shown by the lower reducing capacity ( figure 6 ) and reduced q y ( figure 3f ) of completely vs. partially submersed fronds ( figure 3d ). this sensitivity may be the result of reduced gas exchange ( voesenek et al., 2006 ), or the enhanced activity of symbiotic surface organisms ( koch and barthlott, 2009 ) ; both phenomena can lead to anoxia ( blokhina et al., 2003 ; banti et al., 2010 ). nonetheless, the differences between the submersion treatments illustrate the sensitivity of the fronds to different conditions and allow for nuanced evaluation of heat effects. stress response includes changes in morphology, cellular functions, metabolism, and ultimately gene expression. because of the reduced metabolism under dry conditions, it is likely that dry tissue shows reduced susceptibility to heat damage. the co - variance between desiccation and heat may induce changes in cell wall and thus frond shape ( wu et al., 2018 ) a suitable indicator for heat stress of dry material ( figure 2 ). however, fronds expanded even after exposure to 65°c ; therefore, heat stress cannot be assessed solely through changes in shape or color. changes in frond shape and color in response to increasing temperature, dehydrated pleopeltis fronds became thinner, pinnae curled tighter ( figures 2b, c ), and after exposure to ≥ 45°c fronds became brittle. such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall","Desiccation Mitigates Heat Stress in the Resurrection Fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,Moon Surface,2020
1086,PMC7733933,discussion,1,"2b, c ), and after exposure to ≥ 45°c fronds became brittle. such dramatic changes are likely a response to the combination of water loss and heat that reduces matrix hydration and therefore affects shape and elasticity of cell wall polymers ( lima et al., 2013 ). these changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores ( ballesteros et al., 2017 ). among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall ( willats et al., 2001 ) and heat sensitivity ( lima et al., 2013 ). loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation ( willats et al., 2001 ; bethke et al., 2016 ). pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temperatures, but further research is needed to assess the status of pectin in the cell wall of dried pleopeltis fronds. fronds exposed to 30 – 50°c fully expanded upon rehydration ( at 25°c ) and did not show necrosis, or changes in shape of the fronds ( data not shown ). discolorations of hydrated fronds after exposure to ≥ 35°c ( figures 2e – i ) and re - hydrated fronds after exposure to > 55°c ( figure 2 ) indicate that these fronds have experienced stress beyond their thermal tolerance resulting in chloroplast or chlorophyll degradation, which eventually leads to senescence ( jespersen et al., 2016 ) and programmed cell death ( pcd ) ( qu et al., 2009 ; wang et al., 2015 ). one of the key enzymes known to regulate the breakdown of chlorophyll is pheophytinase ( schelbert et al., 2009 ). it is possible that the activity of this enzyme increases at high temperatures, similar to observations in bentgrass ( jespersen et al., 2016 ). stress - induced chlorophyll degradation is also affected by ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and ros ( xu and huang, 2007 ). these compounds also influence ps ii - mediated electron transport ( xu and huang, 2007 ; griffiths et al., 2014 ), and membrane - bound ion channels ( demidchik, 2018 ), proteins, and lipids ( ve","Desiccation Mitigates Heat Stress in the Resurrection Fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,Moon Surface,2020

( 2005 ). reduced cat activity and high amounts of hydroperoxides may lead to an oxidative environment that then enhances consumption of gsh, a phenomenon also observed in arabidopsis ( queval et al., 2011 ) and barley mutants ( smith et al., 1985 ) that lack cat activity. gsh - oxidation increases during dehydration ( john and hasenstein, 2018 ) and heat - stressed, dried fronds maintain their high gsh levels up to 40°c ( figure 10 ). thus, gsh oxidizing enzymes have greater heat tolerance than cat. it is also possible that the accumulation of the oxidized form of gsh ( gssg ) in chloroplasts and vacuoles ( queval et al., 2011 ) is important for redox regulation, especially during stress ( smith et al., 1985 ; tommasini et al., 1993 ). hydrated fronds accumulate high levels of hydro - ( figure 7 ) and lipid hydroperoxide ( figure 8 ) up to 40°c. these stress indicators could be a response to electrolyte leakage ( figure 4 ), as reported for bentgrass ( liu and huang, 2000 ). however, unlike bentgrass which showed increased lipid peroxide and electrolyte leakage, pleopeltis exhibited increased electrolyte leakage ( figure 4 ) but looh content decreased at > 40°c ( figure 8 ), which could result from interactions between peroxide ( figure 7 ) and membrane - bound unsaturated fatty acids ( figures 11b, c ) ( blokhina et al., 2003 ). these results suggest that ( hydrated ) pleopeltis membranes are affected even by temperatures below ≤ 40°c. because cat ( figure 9 ) and gs","Desiccation Mitigates Heat Stress in the Resurrection Fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733933/,Moon Surface,2020

( 2019 ) recently measured an average instantaneous uva - uvb flux of mw cm −2 on a meteorological balloon mission flown to the middle stratosphere ; the total combined dose measured was 1. 9 kj. in comparison, mw cm – 2 was the reported value to be expected at the surface of mars for uva - uvb according to calculations from schuerger et al. ( 2003 ). surprisingly few uvc measurements have been obtained for earth ’ s middle stratosphere but caro et al. ( 2019 ) modeled an expected range of 0. 1 – 1 μw cm – 2 for altitudes above the ozone layer. besides intense uv radiation ( derived levels in this study ), we measured ionizing radiation in the middle stratosphere with the m - 42 active dosimeter. this was the first successful m - 42 flight test in preparation for the dosimetry suite onboard the upcoming matroshka astrorad radiation experiment on the nasa artemis i mission ( berger et al., 2019 ). at the km float altitude on the marsbox mission, the dose rate was almost constant, around 75. 5 ± 13 μgy day – 1. in comparison, the dose rate measured on the surface of mars for the same time period would approach 260 μgy day – 1. a more comprehensive radiation biophysics analysis ( e. g., monte carlo calculations ) will be reported later alongside additional balloon flight measurements from a joint nasa - dlr long - duration antarctic mission flown in december 2019. in the meantime, we point readers interested in the ionizing radiation levels of the middle stratosphere over new mexico to the rad - x mission results from mertens ( 2016 ). bacterial survival the endurance of s. shabanensis, a non - pigmented halophile, to the ( derived ) uv dose of 1148 kj m – 2 during the balloon flight was unanticipated considering the original isolation source for the species was a deep - sea brine pool with no direct illumination from sunlight. our stratosphere balloon mission results for s. shabanensis ( partial resistance to uv exposure ) reveal a wide variability in uv response based on the model bacterium studied. it was previously reported that even vegetative escherichia",MARSBOx: Fungal and Bacterial Endurance From a Balloon-Flown Analog Mission in the Stratosphere,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937622/,Mars Surface,2021

1120,PMC8044432,introduction,0,"introduction opportunities to perform biological studies in space are rare due to high costs and a limited number of funding sources, rocket launches, and spaceflight crew hours for experimental procedures. in addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the united states and abroad. as a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and / or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, co 2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism ' s health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight ( rutter et al., 2020 ). in order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized. there is presently no consensus on how best to analyze rna - seq data, and the impact of analysis tool selection on results is an active field of research. indeed, selections of trimming parameters ( williams et al., 2016 ), read aligner ( yang et al., 2015 ), quantification tool ( teng et al., 2016 ), and differential expression detection algorithm ( costa - silva et al. 2017 ) all affect results. because of such challenges, groups such as encode and minseqe have developed standardized analysis pipelines for better comparison of rna - seq datasets ( encode project consortium et al., 2020 ; functional genomics data society, 2012 ). the nasa genelab database ( https : / / genelab - data. ndc. nasa. gov / genelab / projects ) was created as a central repository for spaceflight - related omics - data. the repository includes data from experiments that profile transcription ( rna - seq, microarray ), dna / rna methylation, protein expression, metabolite pools, and metagenomes. the most prevalent data type in this repository is rna - seq from organisms exposed to spaceflight conditions. as of august 2020, the nasa genelab database has over eighty datasets with rna - sequencing data ( table s1 ). these datasets include homo sapiens ( human ), mus musculus ( mouse ), drosophila melanogaster ( fruit fly ), arabidopsis thaliana ( model higher plant ), oryzias latipes ( japanese rice fish",NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline: standardized processing of short-read RNA-seq data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044432/,Mars Surface,2021

1124,PMC8044432,results,0,"results data pre - processing : quality control and trimming there are three distinct steps to the rcp, the first of which is data preprocessing ( figure 2 a ). the pipeline begins with quality control ( qc ) of raw fastq files from a short - read illumina sequencer using the fastqc software ( andrews, 2010 ) ( figure 2 b ). fastqc is one of the most widely used qc programs for short - read sequencing data. it provides information that can be used to assess sample and sequencing quality, including base statistics, per base sequencing quality, per sequence quality scores, per base sequence content, per base gc content, per sequence gc content, per base n content, sequence length distributions, sequence duplication levels, overrepresented sequences, and k - mer content. figure 2 data preprocessing ( pipeline step 1 ) : quality control and trimming ( a ) data preprocessing pipeline. fastq files from illumina base - calling software are quality checked using fastqc and multiqc. data are then trimmed using trimgalore and are re - checked for quality ; ( b ) flags used for fastqc program ; ( c ) flags used for multiqc program ; ( d ) flags used for trimgalore program ; trimmed reads ( ∗fastq. gz ) are then used as input data for fastqc ( b ) followed by multiqc ( c ) to generate trimmed read quality metrics. tool versions used to process each dataset are included in the rna - seq processing protocol in the glds repository. the fastqc program is run on each individual sample file. however, reviewing the fastqc results for each sample file can be tedious and time consuming. experiments typically have many sample files ( biological and / or technical replicates ) for multiple experimental conditions ( spaceflight, ground control, etc. ). for this reason, we also use the multiqc package ( ewels et al., 2016 ) ( figure 2 c ) to create a summary statistics report that includes the same quality control result categories from fastqc across all experiment samples. after performing quality control on the raw fastq data, reads are trimmed using trimgalore ( krueger 2019 ) to remove sequencing adapters and low - quality bases that would disrupt read mapping during the data processing pipeline step ( figure 2 d ). trimgalore is a wrapper program that uses the cutadapt program (",NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline: standardized processing of short-read RNA-seq data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044432/,Mars Surface,2021

1139,PMC8044432,discussion,0,"discussion the differentially expressed genes calculated by the rcp can be further explored with a variety of tools designed for higher - order analysis. for example, there are tools that can look for enriched pathways, gene ontology terms, or protein and / or metabolite networks. popular software tools among the genelab working group members include webgestalt ( liao et al., 2019 ), string ( szklarczyk et al., 2019 ), gsea ( subramanian et al., 2005 ), piano ( varemo et al. 2013 ), reactome ( szklarczyk et al., 2019 ), and toppfun ( chen et al., 2009 ). there is no universal consensus on which tools are the most useful for higher - order analysis ( nguyen et al., 2019 ). rcp users are encouraged to try multiple tools in order to analyze their data from a variety of perspectives. the rcp has been designed to handle sequencing experiments that either lack or include the ercc rna spike - in mix — a set of 96 polyadenylated rnas that can be used during differential gene expression calculation to normalize read counts across samples ( munro et al., 2014 ). however, the use of normalization according to ercc spike - ins remains controversial among awg members, and munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio ( lodr ), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias ( munro et al., 2014 ). for this reason, ercc normalization remains optional in the genelab pipeline, and both kinds of dge outputs are provided in the genelab database. in addition, ercc spike - in could have two other usages. first, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as rlog and vst when normalizing the spike - in rnas along with all other genes. second, most normalization methods of rna - seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. comparing spike - in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption. a high number of biological replicates can increase certainty in the differentially expressed genes determined by the rcp. however, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for deseq2",NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline: standardized processing of short-read RNA-seq data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044432/,Mars Surface,2021
1140,PMC8044432,discussion,1,"rcp. however, conducting experiments in spaceflight often limits the number of biological replicates that a researcher can include. therefore, it is important to note that at least three biological replicates are required for the pipeline, specifically for deseq2, to perform its statistical methods. however, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate ( fdr ) ( schurch et al., 2016 ). finally, rna - seq datasets hosted on genelab that do not contain biological replicates are only processed up until unnormalized ( raw ) counts are obtained, the step right before deseq2 is used for dge calculation. more advanced rcp users might have additional data inquiries that fall beyond the scope of this pipeline. for this reason, there are two parts of the pipeline that include additional output that are not used in our differential gene expression computation. the first is in the output from star, mapping output is also provided in genomic coordinates. this is useful for obtaining reads that are mapped outside of the reference transcriptome. for example, this may be used to find novel genes, transcripts, or exons that have not yet been annotated by consortiums. the second part of the pipeline with alternative output files is rsem. this also provides transcript - level counts that can be used to investigate differential isoform expression. moreover, intermediate files are provided as outputs to allow users to use components of the pipeline that they find useful. the genelab database also includes other types of transcriptomic data. as discussed in this article, the rcp is not used for microarray data that are fundamentally different, and the awg is still debating the best approach for cross - dataset comparisons between microarrays. genelab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by pacific biosciences ' ( pacbio ) single - molecule real - time ( smrt ) sequencing ( roberts et al. 2013 ) and oxford nanopore technologies ' ( ont ) nanopore sequencing ( jain et al., 2016 ). long - read data would be processed with similar steps to the rcp but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long - read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base - calling error rate. currently, long - reads are typically used for dna sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the iss using ont for de novo assembly of the escherichia",NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline: standardized processing of short-read RNA-seq data,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044432/,Mars Surface,2021

1146,PMC8169688,introduction,0,"introduction while the majority of spaceflight studies focus on the physiological responses during or immediately after flight, readaptation to nominal gravitational environments is also an important factor in astronaut health. this is particularly important for future exploratory missions to the moon ( 0. 166 g ) or mars ( 0. 38 g ) involving long - duration exposures to microgravity ( 0 g ) and elevated doses of ionizing irradiation. both the adaptation to spaceflight, and the readaptation to planetary gravitational environments, involve multiple physiological systems. currently, short and the long - term consequences of prolonged exposure to deep spaceflight environments are largely unknown. there are several consequences to living in low - earth orbit. these include edema due to fluid and cardiovascular deconditioning 1, myelin degeneration 2, disorientation and motor control deficits 3, 4, visual deficits 5, endocrine and hormonal alterations 6, muscle tone wasting 7, and bone loss due to lack of mechanical loading 8. upon return to earth, there is a period of readaptation that includes acute motion sickness, unsteadiness, imbalance due to gravity - induced vestibular fluid shifts 9, and blood pressure changes 10 – 12. most notably, space anemia 13, 14 was re - classified as post - flight anemia, because of inconsistencies reported in key hematological parameters, including red blood cell ( rbc ) counts and mean corpuscular volumes ( mpv ). this was attributed to the timing of blood sample collections occurring at post - flight return versus in - flight retrieval 10, 14, 15. mission duration can also affect post - flight recovery, whereby longer missions result in prolonged recovery post - mission 16. this becomes an important risk factor to consider for exploratory missions to mars. indeed, understanding how immune and hematological cells compensate in response to the changing gravitational environment becomes particularly important as crew currently rehabilitate to earth ’ s gravity for multiple months post - flight 17. yet, this timeframe may be problematic on planetary bodies with reduced gravity. therefore, a better understanding of blood differentials and their transcriptional regulatory patterns are essential for successful development of countermeasures to be used on future exploratory missions to the lunar surface and mars. ground - based models of spaceflight are developed to easily explore the impacts of the spaceflight environment on physiology. indeed, we previously reported that a 21 - day, protracted exposure of 0. 04 gy low",Immunological and hematological outcomes following protracted low dose/low dose rate ionizing radiation and simulated microgravity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169688/,Orbit,2021

1167,PMC8191917,introduction,0,"introduction parasitoid ( parasitic ) wasps have an obligatory relationship with their insect hosts. engaged in a biological “ arms race, ” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. for reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts ’ behavior, development and immune system. their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression [ 1 – 3 ]. drosophila and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses [ 4, 5 ]. the generalist leptopilina heterotoma ( lh ) succeeds on the drosophila species within and beyond the melanogaster group. its close relative, l. boulardi ( lb ), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group. both wasps are highly successful on d. melanogaster ; they consume its developing larval and pupal stages to emerge as free - living adults [ 6 ]. oviposition into second - to - early - third d. melanogaster larval hosts by lb and lh wasps yields divergent immunological effects. lb infection activates many components of humoral and cellular immunity : toll - nf - κb, jak - stat, and the melanization pathways and their target genes are transcriptionally upregulated ; there is a burst of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation of blood cells ( also called hemocytes ) in the lymph gland and in circulation. if the immune responses are strong and sustained, macrophages and lamellocytes encapsulate and kill wasp eggs [ 7 – 11 ]. lh infection in contrast suppresses immune gene expression and kills immature and mature larval hemocytes [ 12, 13 ]. lb and lh females ( and also l. victoriae, a sister species of lh ) produce discrete immune - suppressive extracellular vesicle - ( ev ) like structures in their venom glands ( called multi - strategy extracellular vesicles, msevs in lh and venosomes in lb ) [ 14, 15 ]. previously called virus like particles [ 16 – 18 ], these evs lack clear viral features [ 15, 19 ]. they are produced in the venom gland, a structure made up of the long gland and a reservoir. the secretory cells of the long gland synthesize and secrete proteins, some of which are initially incorporated into discrete non - spiked",A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its host’s blood cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8191917/,Moon Surface,2021

1222,PMC9098553,introduction,0,"introduction the return of humans to the moon during the nasa artemis program 1 has elevated scientific interest in the lunar environment and its impact on terrestrial biology 2, 3. since the return to the moon is envisioned as a dedicated, longer - term commitment to lunar exploration, questions of the lunar environmental impact on biology and biological systems have become a significant part of the lunar exploration agenda. plants have long been envisioned as part of lunar habitats 4 – 8 and exploration environments 9, 10. however, until the current study, the interactions between lunar materials and terrestrial biology were unaddressed in the era of modern molecular biology, and there had yet to be any experiments where plants were actually grown in the true lunar regolith. understanding the impact of sustained exposure of terrestrial biology to lunar regolith, and determining the efficacy of lunar regolith as a viable in situ resource, is important to the concept of returning to the moon for long durations. therefore, we used plant growth and gene expression ( e. g., 11 – 13 ) to both tests the fundamental impact of lunar regolith on terrestrial biology, and provide an initial evaluation of regolith as a matrix for plant growth systems in lunar exploration habitats. plants are key components of the biological sciences within and in support of space exploration. as model organisms, plants provide insights into gravity, radiation, and other space - related biological phenomena, and therefore help drive an understanding of the physiological adaptation of terrestrial biology to space exploration environments. there is an expanding wealth of literature documenting this progress, e. g., 11, 14 – 19. plants also make available potentially essential components to the long - term habitation of space and extraterrestrial surfaces by providing food and oxygen, recycling water, and scrubbing carbon dioxide from human habitats. however, many designs of extraterrestrial plant growth systems largely rely on hydroponic systems 20, 21, in part due to the lack of information on the efficacy of using in situ materials, such as planetary regolith, as a growth substrate. information on plant growth in lunar regolith, therefore, informs fundamental biology interactions within the lunar environment, and helps scale options for the use of plants in lunar life support scenarios. the apollo moon landings were a critical point in the science of space exploration, not only in the accomplishment of lunar visits, but also in that terrestrial biology would be in contact with extraterrestrial material, and samples of that material would be intentionally returned to earth. the first contact between terrestrial biology and lunar regolith was",Plants grown in Apollo lunar regolith present stress-associated transcriptomes that inform prospects for lunar exploration,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9098553/,Moon Surface,2022

1264,PMC9287483,introduction,0,"introduction space exploration is one of the most fascinating enterprises for humans. it is becoming increasingly evident that plants are an essential companion of humans in space exploration as a privileged source of high quality nutrients and oxygen as well as waste recycling systems, that is, as a key component of bioregenerative life support systems ( fu et al., 2016 ). thus, the search for the most efficient way of cultivating plants in space, including the knowledge of the mechanisms of adaptation of plants to the space environment and the careful selection of plant species, varieties and genetic lines, are current major challenges of plant space research ( medina et al., 2021 ). the most difficult parameter to overcome in the space environment is altered gravity level, because all other parameters such as oxygen and nutrient levels, humidity, temperature, or light conditions can be adjusted. only cosmic radiation represents a challenge comparable to gravity because of the lack of 100 % effective protective shields. on the other hand, plants, like every organism on earth, have evolved under a constant gravity level and its modification or absence may be a difficult challenge to overcome for an organism. there are different ways to study the effect of microgravity on an organism ( bohmer and schleiff, 2019 ). real microgravity research onboard the international space station ( iss ) provides the most valuable information ( vandenbrink and kiss, 2016 ), but it involves high cost and the access to it is very limited. compared to a typical ground experiment, which usually involves practically unlimited sample size and the necessary number of performing personnel, spaceflight research imposes major limitations, including the size of and access to experiment equipment and the availability of trained staff and supplies needed to perform the scientific work. furthermore, there are significant technical challenges that need to be overcome in the design and development of the experimental hardware necessary to operate in low gravity conditions. retrieval, processing and storage of biological samples need to be optimized, in some cases by developing complex and costly procedures. despite all these constraints, six decades of research on the effects of long - and short - term missions to space have resulted in a consistent knowledge of many aspects of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, mainly exposure to microgravity, on biological systems. the story started with the sending to space of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. the soviet oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. soon after, the facility was",Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9287483/,Orbit,2022
1265,PMC9287483,introduction,1,"of the first plant materials which were grown on unmanned vehicles. the soviet oasis 1 plant growth system, the first facility devoted to space plant research in history, was flown on the cosmos 368 flight as early as 1970. soon after, the facility was used by cosmonauts in the manned salyut 1 mission in 1971 to grow different plant crop species. since then, different plant cultivation experiments have been flown on crewed vehicles, including the soviet / russian salyut and mir, the american shuttle, the chinese shenzou, and the iss. continuous subsystem improvements and increasing knowledge of plant responses to the spaceflight environment has led to the design of veggie and the advanced plant habitat, latest in the series of plant growth systems installed in the iss ( ray et al., 2019 ; zabel et al., 2016 ). all these steps were directed to achieve the main objective of spaceflight biology, which was to gain an understanding of adaptive processes triggered by terrestrial organisms when they are confronted with the novel space environment. the knowledge of the environmental limits of terrestrial biology in spaceflight is key to the design of successful space exploration strategies ( des marais et al., 2008 ). during spaceflight, exposure to a novel environment, previously unknown for terrestrial organisms, causes them to modify their growth and development patterns to a greater or lesser extent. these patterns are characterized by certain gene expression profiles capable of guiding growth and ensuring survival. during spaceflight, some sets of genes that were repressed in other environmental conditions are expressed and some other sets of genes are repressed in an attempt to cope with the new environment and adapt, or acclimate, to it ( paul et al., 2012 ). this response is not unique to plants, but it is enhanced in these organisms by the great reserve of plasticity exhibited by plant genomes, that enables them to respond to unforeseen environmental conditions, such as gravity alteration ( medina et al., 2021 ). in general, this plasticity is necessary because of the sessile character of plants that immobilizes them to the ground and disables them to escape to another place if the environmental conditions became adverse. one of the sources of genome plasticity is gene redundancy, a feature much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. plants have undergone extensive duplications ( up to four times ) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes ( wang et al., 2011 ). for example",Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9287483/,Orbit,2022
1266,PMC9287483,introduction,2,"much more extended in plants than in any other taxonomic group. plants have undergone extensive duplications ( up to four times ) of large genomic regions, producing a large amount of duplicated genes ( wang et al., 2011 ). for example, multiple cyclins and cdks involved in cell proliferation control exhibit redundant mechanisms for producing the same effect in cell cycle checkpoints ( francis, 2011 ). in addition to gene redundancy, quicker mechanisms like transposable elements or epigenetic processes, such as dna methylation operate under environmental stress ( lukens and zhan, 2007 ). this article revises the results of some relevant experiments performed in the iss during the last decade and the knowledge acquired from them in terms of changes in gene expression at the global genome level ( space omics ). these changes are related to the acclimation or adaptation of plants to survive, grow and develop under the altered gravity conditions of extraterrestrial environments, either the microgravity characterizing spaceflight, or the partial gravity levels that can be found in the moon and mars surfaces. together with gravity, another environmental stimulus is analyzed extensively, which is light. both gravity and light are responsible for the two main tropisms that drive plant growth, namely gravitropism and phototropism. the regulatory effects of light and gravity on plant growth are closely related. an outstanding recent example of this relationship is the light regulation of the expression of lazy4, a gene that plays an important role in the gravitropic response of both shoots and roots ( yang et al., 2020 ). in addition, upregulation of genes involved in a fundamental light - dependent function, such as photosynthesis, has been found as a response to microgravity condition in spaceflight, and, interestingly, this response occurred in etiolated plants, in the absence of any light signal ( kruse et al., 2020 ). the question on whether the deleterious effects of altered gravity could be compensated by light, or not, is critical for the success of plant culture in future human settlements on other planets, but attention to other suboptimal environmental parameters that may be unavoidable in spaceflight as cosmic radiation or reduced access to water or gas exchange may be also evaluated. in that regard, this review pays particular attention and its organized by the hardware used in each experiment, being crucial to understand the differential results observed in the “ habitats ” provided for each facility, in terms of sub",Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9287483/,Orbit,2022

1269,PMC9287483,introduction,5,"genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and oxidative stress in col - 0 seedlings. most of these genes are expressed in root hairs ( class iii peroxidase genes ) independently of actin pathways because they were also downregulated in the other arabidopsis line included in this experiment, the act2 - 3 mutant. these gene expression changes led to shorter root hairs in space - grown seedlings. it is unclear whether this effect was due to microgravity per se or it was a consequence of other spaceflight environmental conditions producing stress, such as hypoxia, which produces the same phenotypic effect. actually, the bric hardware system has several limitations : one is that the seedlings grow confined in small sealed containers for extended periods of time, and other is the absence of orbit 1 g control which makes it difficult to distinguish true microgravity effects from other secondary spaceflight effects ( kwon et al., 2015 ). bric - 16 - cytoskeleton study ( investigations of the plant cytoskeleton in microgravity with gene profiling and cytochemistry ) focused on gene expression changes in shoots of ler - 0 plants. the functional analysis showed that many upregulated transcripts in spaceflight conditions were implicated in metabolic process and transport. most of these genes were localized in the extracellular matrix and involved in cell wall modification. on the other hand, and unlike the other two bric - 16 experiments, the downregulated genes were often involved in stress response. this result was associated with the fact that the transcriptional analysis only included shoots. at the same time, an abundance of adventitious roots ( immediately transport oxygen from the substrate to shoots ) was observed in spaceflight seedlings, suggesting that roots may undergo greater hypoxic stress than shoots during spaceflight. therefore, pooling all plant organs together for a single analysis could provide an incomplete picture. the bric - 16 was a cluster of spaceflight experiments performed during the same space mission ( sts - 131 ) in the same hardware ( biological research in canister, bric ) with the goal of studying the longer - term plant survival response in the spaceflight environment. despite these common features, and even though transcripts within the same functional categories ( stress response, defense, metabolic processes and cell wall modification ) were found to be involved in the response in the different experiments, some differing results were obtained. these differences were associated to the specific experimental conditions of each one of the",Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9287483/,Orbit,2022

1279,PMC9287483,introduction,15,"abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attack, salt, and drought stress, are elicitors of differential dna methylation ( zhou et al., 2019 ). many genes of the networks involved in the response to these stresses are differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. the results indicated that although large scale alteration of the average methylation level was not detected in cg, chg and chh contexts between flight and ground dna, thousands of specifically differentially methylated cytosines were discovered with clear organ - specific patterns. in roots, hypomethylated chh sites predominated whereas leaves showed a predominance of hypermethylated chh sites. in leaves, about one - fifth of the genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight ( 143 out of 743 ) were also differentially methylated ( dmc - deg ), but in roots the fraction was about one - third ( 75 differentially expressed genes, 21 of which were also differentially methylated ). gene ontology analysis detected stress response to abiotic stimulus, temperature, radiation, and light stimulus categories in roots. in leaves, the detected categories included response to stressors of temperature, radiation and light, plus chemical stress, oxidative stress and a response to oxygen - containing compounds. in addition, in leaves, a 46 % of dmc - deg set were associated with reactive oxygen species ( ros ). these results suggested that although dna methylation may play a significant role in a portion of the genes regulated by spaceflight, it is clearly not the only factor in this regulation. furthermore, ros genes may play a unique role in the adaptation of plants to the spaceflight ( zhou et al., 2019 ). furthermore, in “ the advanced plant experiment - 04 - epigenetic expression ” experiment, launched on the spacex mission crs - 10 on 19 february 2017, two methylation mutant lines ( met1 - 7 and elp2 - 5 ) were grown on the iss to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type ( col - 0 ). the plants grew in the veggie hardware ( both on the iss and in the isees chamber ) with constant light conditions for 11 days, before being fixed in rnalater into kfts. once on earth, leaf and root tissues were dissected and, from each sample, whole - genome bisulfite sequencing ( wgbs ) and rna sequencing ( rnaseq ) was performed ( table",Recent transcriptomic studies to elucidate the plant adaptive response to spaceflight and to simulated space environments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9287483/,Orbit,2022

1301,PMC9445043,introduction,0,"introduction growing healthy plants in space is a major goal towards the viability of long - term space missions as plants can provide food for astronauts and benefit mental health. the space environment includes multiple stresses for plant growth including different levels of gravity, radiation, decreased nutrient delivery and water recycling 1, 2. the international space station provides an ideal experimental setting for the study of plant growth and development under space conditions and many experiments have been conducted with plants on the iss 1, 3. reduced gravity on the iss results in disoriented plant growth unless light is provided to activate directional growth from phototropism. effects of the spaceflight environment on the iss include reduced cell elongation 4 or altered cell division 5 in roots. at the cellular level, the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons as well as the cell wall are altered under microgravity 6 – 8. other cellular organelles are altered under microgravity conditions include mitochondria, plastids and er 6. interestingly, vacuole numbers increased in root apical cells for arabidopsis seedlings grown on the iss 9, and vacuole volume increases in certain cells in microgravity 10, 11. moreover, proteins involved in intracellular membrane trafficking were found to show altered abundance in microgravity 12 – 14. those results suggest vacuolar development as well as trafficking are disrupted in microgravity, but overall, there is a large gap in documenting the effect of spaceflight on the organization of cellular organelles 15. the plant vacuole is a large essential organelle in plant cells and is important for cell elongation, recycling, and storage, among many other functions 16 – 18. vacuole enlargement is concomitant with cell growth along the developmental gradient represented by the longitudinal axis of the root. vacuole enlargement along this gradient requires homotypic membrane fusion, which is mediated by two conserved complexes, the homotypic vacuole protein sorting ( hops ) and soluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ( snare ) 19. both hops and the vacuolar snare complexes have vacuole or pre - vacuole - specific subunits that provide specificity to membrane fusion. the vacuolar snare complex is formed by syp22, vti11, syp51, and either vamp727 20 or vamp713 / vamp711 21 – 23. a loss of function allele of vti11, z",Microgravity enhances the phenotype of Arabidopsis zigzag-1 and reduces the Wortmannin-induced vacuole fusion in root cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9445043/,Orbit,2022
